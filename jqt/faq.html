<H1>Frequently-Asked Questions about JQTs</H1>

<P>
Q1. What is a JPEG encoder/decoder/transcoder? </br>
A1. A JPEG encoder converts an uncompressed imagefile into a
compressed JPEG file. A JPEG decoder converts a compressed JPEG file
back into an uncompressed imagefile. A JPEG transcoder takes
a compressed JPEG file, performs some sort of processing on the file,
and returns another compressed JPEG file.
</P>

<P>
Q2: Will JPEG encoding and then JPEG decoding an uncompressed image file
yield the original file back? </br>
A2: Generally speaking, no. JPEG is a lossy compression algorithm,
with the goal of perceptually-lossless, but not bit-accurate, image
compression. JPEG encoders allow the user to tradeoff compressed file
size and image quality: if a user chooses a sufficiently small file
size, the decoded image will have noticeable visual artifacts,
including blockiness, ringing, and color shifting.
</P>

<P>
Q3. What is a JPEG Quality Transcoder (JQT)?  </br>
A3. A JQT takes a compressed JPEG file as input, and produces as
output a JPEG file that has reduced visual artifacts, at the expense
of increased file size.
</P>

<P>
Q4. Does the JQT perform a full image decompression? </br>
A4. No. JPEG compression can be broken up into two parts, a lossy part
that converts pixels into a quantized spatial-frequency representation
(removing irrelevancy from the image), and a lossless part that packs
this intermediate frequency-space representation into the smallest
number of bits (removing redundancy from the intermediate form). Our
JQT undoes the lossless compression, performs image processing on the
intermediate representation, then reapplies lossless compression to
create the output JPEG.
</P>

<P>
Q5. What sort of image processing does the JQT perform? </br>
A5. The JQT uses neural networks to estimate the information lost
during quantization of the spatial-frequency representation of an
image. The neural networks get trained using a large database of color
images. Note that the specific images and the general performance
numbers we quote on this website are NOT images from the training
database, but from a separate independent test set.
</P>

<P>
Q6. Isn't the neural network "creating information from nothing? </br>
A6. No, it isn't. JPEG compression works compressing a small
window of an image, for one color channel at a time. Our neural
networks look over larger windows of the image, and at all three
color channels, to estimate the information lost during quantization
of the small window of one color plane. In other words, the neural
network looks at other information sources not used by the original
compression algorithm.
</P>

<P>
Q7. Isn't the neural network just memorizing details about the training
set images? How does it work on novel images? </br>
A7. We used an independent test set of 132 images to measure the performance of
the system; this test set was not used during the training of the
network. All numbers quoted in the web site are measured on this test
set. The two images used for examples are part of this independent
test set.
</P>

<P>
Q8. Tell me more about how the algorithm works. </br>
A8. See this <A HREF="jqt.pdf">technical report</A>; this TR is an
updated version of a paper due to appear in the peer-reviewed journal
Neural Computation in a few months.
</P>

<P>
Q9. What sort of JPEGs does the system work on? </br>
A9. Right now, it works on 8-bit JPEG/JFIF color files sampled at
4:2:2 (i.e. the two color channels are subsampled in X and Y by a
factor of two, relative to the luminance channel), which are the
majority of the images out there on the net. It doesn't yet
work on 1:1:1 or monochrome images -- we are planning to train
up nets for these two image types as well. The nets are trained
for PhotoCD-type gamma correction (gamma = 2.5), although we've
found the networks to be pretty immune to gamma in practice.
