<H1>Image Enhancement: Sample Images</H1>

<P>
In some applications, a JQT is added to a network architecture to
improve the image quality for end users, rather than maintaining a
constant image quality while reducing bandwidth. In this section, we
show an example of quality enhancement. A 24-bit color display is
necessary to fully appreciate this example: 8-bit displays use color
mapping techniques with artifacts of their own, which are not helped
by the JQT processing.
</P>

<P>
The image below is compressed using the quantization tables
recommended in the JPEG standard. Most commercial and free JPEG
encoders use linear scalings of these tables to provide a filesize
vs. image quality tradeoff. The image below was compressed using a
unity scaling of the tables, achieving a compressed filesize of 9287
bytes.

<P>
Note the moderate image quality: the image basically looks OK, but
some compression artifacts are noticeable.  In particular, notice the
color ringing around the head of the parrot to the right, and the
artifacts around the beak of the parrot to the left. When measured
using our perceptual error metric, which compares the image quality of
the uncompressed and compressed images, it receives a score of 0.0253.
</P>

<P>When our JQT is applied to this test image, it improves the
subjective image quality by reducing the compression artifacts,
as shown below. </P>

<P> 
When measured by our perceptual error metric, it achieves a score of
0.0238. To put this number in perspective, the JPEG standard
recommends halving their recommended quantization tables, in order to
achieve an image quality that is "usually perceptually
indistinguishable" from the original image. When compressed with the
indistinguishable tables, this sample image achieves a perceptual
metric score of 0.0193. Ideally, our JQT could reduce the perceptual
error score of the original image from 0.0253 to this "perceptually
indistinguishable" 0.0193 : we define this ideal situation to be 100
percent perceptual error reduction . In practice, it reduces the
perceptual error to 0.0238. We can express the JQT performance as the
percentage value 100*((0.0253-0.0238)/(0.0253-0.0193)) = 25 percent.
</P>

<P>
To use a more common signal processing
metric, our JQT improves PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio) by 0.58 dB;
if the JQT was able to improve the original image to "usually
perceptually indistinguishable" it would have registered a 2.44 dB
improvement.
</P>

<P>
We measured the percentage reduction of artifacts over an independent
test set of 132 images (nominally 384 by 256), and found an average
perceptual error reduction of 31 percent, and an average PSNR
improvement of 0.56 dB.
