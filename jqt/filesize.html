<H1>Filesize Reduction: Sample Images</H1>

<P>
In this section, we show an example of bandwidth reduction using
a JQT. A 24-bit color display is necessary to fully appreciate
this example: 8-bit displays use color mapping techniques with
artifacts of their own, which are not helped by the JQT processing.
</P>

<P>
The image below is compressed using the quantization tables
recommended in the JPEG standard. Most commercial and free JPEG
encoders use linear scalings of these tables to provide a filesize
vs. image quality tradeoff. The image below was compressed using a
unity scaling of the tables, achieving a compressed filesize of 9353
bytes.

Sample image, compressed in accordance with JPEG standard
recommendations. Note slight artifacts around the lettering, tops, and
rims of hats.  Compressed filesize: 9353 bytes. Perceptual error: 0.0231</td>

<P>
Note the moderate image quality: the image basically
looks OK, but some compression artifacts are noticeable (look at the
text on the yellow hat, and the top edges of all of the hats). When
measured using our perceptual error metric, which compares the
image quality of the uncompressed and compressed images, it
receives a score of 0.0231.
</P>

<P>When our JQT is applied to this test image, it improves the
subjective image quality by reducing the compression artifacts.
We can take advantage of this performance to reduce the filesize
of the initial image, so that this smaller imagefile, processed
by the JQT, also scores a value below 0.0231 on our perceptual error
metric. We do this by scaling the quantization tables used during
the encoding of the image. For this sample image, the filesize
is reduced from 9353 bytes to 8473 bytes, a filesize reduction of 9.4 percent.
</P>

<P> 
This smaller imagefile is shown below (before JQT
processing). Note the artifacts in this image are more severe than the
original image above; it has a perceptual error score of 0.0251.  
</P>

Sample image as above, but with a higher compression rate. File size
is reduced to 8473 bytes -- however, artifacts around the lettering,
tops, and rims of hats are worse, as perceptual error score increases
to 0.0251.

<td width = 600>

<P>
When we apply our JQT to this image, the artifacts are reduced:
compare the image below with the others. The perceptual error metric
for this image is 0.02308, slightly better than the score of the original
image. Note that the filesize of this image has expanded due to JQT
processing, from 8203 bytes to 33,543 bytes -- when used in a web
proxy server, the high-bandwidth local area network links between the
proxy server and the end-user machines can absorb this extra increase.

The image immediately above, after JQT processing. This image has a
perceptual error score less than the top image on this page. Note that
the artifacts around the lettering, tops, and rims of hats are reduced
to the level of the top image.

We measured the average filesize reduction over an independent test
set of 132 color images (nominal size 384 by 256) and found an average
filesize reduction of 11.5 percent.
