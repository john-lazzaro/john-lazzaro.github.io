<h1>Music 209 Projects: Vocals</h1>
<A HREF="../../index.html">Music 209</A> : <A HREF="../index.html">Projects</A> : Vocals
<hr>

<P> These project ideas involve vocals.

<H2><A NAME="gloss">Project: Synthesis, Analysis, and Algorithmic
Composition of Glossolalia Vocals</A></H2>

<P> 
<A TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossolalia">
Glossolalia </A> vocals are vocals whose lyrics are written or
improvised at the phonemic level (as opposed to the word level in an
existing language).

<P>
Some glossolalia lyrics consist of words of a novel language: thus,
the songwriter first invents the syntax and semantics of a new
language, and then writes a song in the language.  Elizabeth Fraser is
believed to use this approach -- the Cocteau Twins song Carolyn's
Fingers uses this technique, available as a legal live recording <A
HREF="http://www.cocteautwins.com/html/media/audio/carolyns_fingers_live.mp3">here</A> (the studio recording is much better, however).

<P>
Other glossolalia lyrics exist only at the phonetic level, and thus
are free of semantics.  It appears that Lisa Gerrard's lyrics usually
take this form.  A legal download example of her style is available <A
HREF="http://www.lisagerrard.com/files/Venteles_demo.mp3">here</A>;
most of the Dead Can Dance albums have at least one track of this
nature (some of the DCD tracks are <I>a cappella</I>).  

<P>
As this <A HREF="http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/band/faq.php#07"
TARGET="_blank"> FAQ entry</A> indicates, Sigur Ros also uses
phonetic-level glossolalia.  Beth Gibbons (Portishead) has also
investigated the technique, as she discusses in this (rare) <A
HREF="http://wnet.suomi.net/kotisivu/heikki.hietala/Interviews/Beth%20Oor.htm"
TARGET="_blank">interview</A>.

<P>
Glossolalia vocals are interesting for concatenative synthesis for
several reasons:
<UL>
<LI>Listeners who do not understand a language are more
tolerant of vocal synthesis artifacts in the language.</LI>
<LI>An artist can design the glossolalia language to avoid
phonetic transitions that cause artifacts in a particular
vocal synthesis algorithm.</LI>
<LI>An artist can relegate lyric design to a generative
algorithm.  One byproduct of this design is that real-time
playing of melodies in the language becomes easier, as
the synthesizer can be aware upcoming phonemes in a song
in advance.  In this real-time scenario, the generative
phonetic algorithm would be guided by the history of the
melody (among other inputs).</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Several types of projects come to mind in this domain.  One idea
(suggested by Adrian Freed) is to design tools for composers to
analyze existing glossolalia languages and to design new languages.
The <I>a cappella</I> recordings of Lisa Gerrard may be good source
material for an analysis project.</P>

<P>
Another project idea is to analyze the artifact properties of
vocal synthesis algorithms, and design generative algorithms
for glossolalia languages and for glossolalia compositions
that minimize artifacts.</P>

<P>
Another project idea is to investigate real-time speech
synthesis from a MIDI controller, by leaving phoneme
selection to an online composition system.

<H2><A NAME="phrase">Project: Lyric Design for Phrase-Based
Vocal Synthesis</A></H2>

<P>
In lecture, we discussed a children's choir <A
HREF="http://www.beladmedia.com/giovani.htm"
TARGET="_blank">product</A> as an example of a successful phrase-based
concatenative system.  The children sang Latin text phrases, which
could be automatically strung together.  Given that most people do not
understand spoken Latin, most listeners would not notice semantic
lyrical issues in the spliced Latin, and would also be more tolerant
of audio artifacts.

<P>
These nice properties won't work for phrase-based vocal synthesis
aimed at popular music in the native language of the listeners.  In
class, we showed an example of a phrase-based pop music vocal product
whose lyric selection seemed to be selected in an <I>ad hoc</I> way,
without concern to the semantics and rhyme structure of concatenation.

<P>
An interesting project would be to consider phrase-based pop song
vocal libraries in a principled way.  Such a project would be driven
both from data (such as Web lyric databases for a particular song
style) and from rules about the structure of lyric and melodic phrases
in the music form.  Ideally, the project would include a small pilot
test (recording a phrase library produced by the phrase generation
system, and hand-concatenating it to produce songs).

<P>
A good introduction to the structure of musical lyrics in pop music is
available in this five-part series: [<A HREF="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec00/articles/lyric.asp" TARGET="_blank">1</A>]
[<A HREF="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jan01/articles/lyric.asp" TARGET="_blank">2</A>]

[<A HREF="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/apr01/articles/lyric.asp" TARGET="_blank">5</A>].  For vocal phrasing ideas, the book analyzed in this
<A HREF="http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/mp.2003.20.4.491" 
TARGET="_blank">review</A> may also be helpful (it is available in
the music library on the stacks).

<P>
The articles linked off of this <A
HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/comppsych.html"
TARGET="_blank">webpage</A> provide a good sample of the machinery used
for the statistical analysis of language.  To learn more, see the the book
described on this <A
HREF="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~martin/slp.html"
TARGET="_blank">webpage</A>.  The webpage contains the Preface and
Chapter 1 of the current edition, and draft versions of many of the
other chapters for the upcoming edition.  These chapters should be
enough to let you know if computational linguistics has a role in your
focus area for the project (in which case you probably want to read
the paper version of the book).
