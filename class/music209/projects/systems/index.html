<P> These project ideas involve computer systems projects to support
concatenative systems.

<H2><A NAME="coresample">Project: CoreSample: A Database Service for
Concatenative Systems</A></H2>

<P> 
CoreSample is an idea for an operating systems API (like CoreAudio and
CoreMIDI on the Mac) for streaming real-time audio from mass storage
devices (disks, Flash memory, etc).  It would simplify the development
of concatenative systems, as it would become unnecessary for an audio
developer to learn the fine points of disk I/O.  A longer description
will be placed here soon; ask the instructors for more information if
you are interested in the project idea.
