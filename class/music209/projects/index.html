<P>
The grade for this course is based on the completion of a single,
semester-long project, whose topic is related to concatenative
synthesis.  The forms a project may take include (but are not limited
to):
<UL>
<LI> Proposal for new and improved algorithms related to concatenative
synthesis (example: a new spectral morphing algorithm).  A good
project of this type should include an audio demonstration of the
algorithm that compares it to existing approaches.</LI>
<LI> Software prototype of a complete concatenative system.</LI>
<LI> Proposal for a new user-interface related to concatenative
systems.  A good project of this type should include storyboards
for showing how the user-interface works, and a comparison with
existing interfaces.</LI>
<LI> A composition or performance that explores a novel use of
concatenative synthesis.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
A project may be a solo effort, or may be a collaboration between
several students.

<P>
A partial list of software tools that may be useful for the
project:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/audio/" TARGET="_blank">CoreAudio APIs</A> from Apple,
<A HREF="http://jackit.sourceforge.net/" TARGET="_blank">Jack</A> for Linux, for those writing
"to the metal".</LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~lazzaro/sa/index.html" TARGET="_blank">sfront</A> for MPEG 4 Structured Audio
(a Music-N style language with real-time support, cross-platform).</LI>
<LI>A 30-day free trial for Max/MSP is available 
<A HREF=" http://cycling74.com/downloads/maxmsp" TARGET="_blank">here.</A>
We can supply students with authorizations to make the
trial version a real version for the rest of the term.
</LI>
<LI>Matlab - information coming soon.</LI>
</UL>

<tr>
<td><A NAME="abstract">Project Abstract</A></td>
<td>March 1, 11:59 PM</td>
<td>A short (one or two page) description of the project.  PDF or
plain text format is fine -- please, no .doc files.  Collaborative
projects should include information on how the work will be split
between team members.  Email this abstract to the instructors (wessel
[at] cnmat [dot] berkeley [dot] edu, lazzaro [at] eecs [dot] berkeley
[dot] edu).</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td><A NAME="progress">Progress Report Presentation</A></td>
<td>March 23 in class</td>
<td>A 10-15 minute presentation to the class, describing the
current status of the project.  Group projects should share
presentation duties between all members.  Audio demos of work
in progress is encouraged.  Primary purpose of presentation is
to solicit feedback from the audience.</td>
<td> 15 percent </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><A NAME="finalp">Final Presentation</A></td>
<td>May 4th in class</td>
<td>A final presentation to the class describing your finished
project.  If your project includes a compositional aspect, excerpts 
of the composition should be played during the presentation.
Software projects should include a live demo.  Nominal presentation
time is 20 minutes, but can be longer if the project requires it (let
us know in advance).
<td> 30 percent </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><A NAME="finalr">Final Report</A></td>
<td>Monday May 8th, 11:59 PM</td>
<td>A final report describing the project: what you planned to do, how
it turned out, lessons learned.  Main body of the report should be a
PDF file, and should be emailed to the instructors by the due date.
In addition to the main body of the report, you may also submit
supporting materials (examples: audio files for completed
compositions, storyboards for a UI, a Quicktime movie showing a demo
of a software application, etc).  Send support materials as separate
emails to the instructors, ideally as a ZIP archive (ZIP file must not
exceed 10 MB -- break it up into a few smaller archives, or if
possible put the file on a web server and send along a link).
