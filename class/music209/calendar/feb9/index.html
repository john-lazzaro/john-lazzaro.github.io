<h1>Music 209 Week 4: Time-Warping and Beat-Matching</h1>

<P>
Concatenation of two rhythmic units may
require the tempos to match.  We describe techniques for matching
tempos without otherwise altering units.</P>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<P>
The lecture covered beat-slicing and overlap-add techniques for
time-warping.  We began with a description of Drumcore, a drumloop
system that handles tempo changing by recording real drummers playing
at many different tempos.  This <A
HREF="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb05/articles/drumcore.htm"
TARGET="_blank">review</A> describes how Drumcore works.

<P>
We then discussed beat-slicing.  Good tutorials on beat splicing are
available <A
HREF="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jun04/articles/beatslicing.htm"
TARGET="_blank">here</A> and <A
HREF="http://emusician.com/mag/square_one/emusic_slice/index.html"
TARGET="_blank">here</A>. We also discussed the beat-slicing
implementation in Pro Tool's Beat Detective feature.  A good tutorial
on Beat Detective is available <A
HREF="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/aug03/articles/protoolsnotes.htm"
TARGET="_blank">here</A>.

<P>
We then turned our focus to overlap-add methods of time warping.  We
began by noting that professional use of these algorithms dates back
to the 1980 (Lexicon 2400).  This <A
HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/~dattorro/2400.htm" TARGET="_blank"
>webpage</A> and this <A
HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/~dattorro/Lexicon.htm" TARGET="_blank"
>webpage</A> describe the overlap-add methods used in the Lexicon
2400.

<P>
We then described the mechanics of overlap-add methods in detail.
This tutorial was adapted from Chapter 2 of Jordi Sanhaume's Ph.D.
thesis, available for download <A
HREF="http://www.iua.upf.es/mtg/publications/Phd-2002-Jordi-Bonada.pdf"
TARGET="_blank">here</A>.

<P>
The SOLA examples we played in class used the PICOLA algorithm.  This
algorithm is described in Annex 5.D (page 128) of this <A
HREF="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~lazzaro/sa/book/append/fdis/SA-FDIS.pdf"
TARGET="_blank">document</A>.  To play with this algorithm, try out
the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~lazzaro/sa/book/saol/wave/index.html#speedt"
TARGET="_blank">speedt</A> SAOL core opcode as implemented in <A
HREF="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~lazzaro/sa/index.html"
TARGET="_blank">sfront</A>.

<P>We ended the lecture with an idea for a class project based on this
<A HREF="http://thebots.net/GWBushSampleArchive.htm"
TARGET="_blank">archive</A> of George Bush speeches.</P>

<P>
Finally, this <A HREF="http://www.dspdimension.com/data/index.html"
TARGET="_blank">website</A> provides a good comparative analysis of
time-warping methods.
