The lecture began with an excellent review of speech related
technologies by guest lecturer <A HREF="http://roberteklund.info/"
TARGET="_blank">Robert Ecklund</A>.

<P>
We then began a discussion of modern techniques for recording lead
vocals in pop songs.  Much of the material was adapted from <A
HREF="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/mar04/articles/computervocals.htm"
TARGET="_blank">this</A> review article in Sound on Sound and <A
HREF="http://mixonline.com/recording/applications/audio_engineer_vocalist/"
TARGET="_blank">this</A> review article in Mix Magazine.

<P>
We discussed pitch correction technology: see this <A
HREF="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct03/articles/vocalfixes.htm"
TARGET="_blank">article</A> for a discussion of using Auto-Tune in a
studio environment, and see this <A
HREF="http://www.antarestech.com/products/avp.shtml"
TARGET="_blank">web page</A> for the Auto-Tune audio examples
presented in class.

<P>
We discussed vocal modeling as an alternative to traditional
equalization -- see this <A
HREF="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb04/articles/tcvoice.htm"
TARGET="_blank">review</A> of a voice modeling product for a good
discussion of how these algorithms work.

<P>
We ended the lecture segment on recording vocals with a discussion
about the quality of Alanis Morissette's intonation on her album
Jagged Little Pill, and how this issue did not prevent the album from
selling 30 million copies.  To read about the recording of this album,

<H2>Singing Synthesis</H2>

<P>
We discussed the Vocaloid singing synthesis system in depth.  These
review articles provide a good introduction to the strengths and
weaknesses of their system: [<A

TARGET="_blank">article1</A>]

A paper on an interesting research system for singing synthesis system
that addresses vibrato in a novel way is available <A

We also discussed products for phrase-level synthesis of children
choirs.  See this product <A
