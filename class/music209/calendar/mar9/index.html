Techniques for synthesizing audio from score notation or guide audio.</P>
<hr>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<P>
We began the lecture with a description of Vocalign, a plug-in for
aligning audio recorded on location during a movie shoot with audio
re-recorded in a studio environment.  An informative review of
Vocalign is available <A TARGET="_blank"
HREF="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul00/articles/synchro.htm">here</A>.
More information is available on the company <A TARGET="_blank"
HREF="http://www.synchroarts.com/">website</A>.

<P>
We then showed how one might implement Vocalign using dynamic time
warping.  We also showed how the Viterbi algorithm (the main algorithm
behind dynamic time warping) could be used for score alignment and for
concatenative synthesis.  This material was based on Chapters 6, 16,
and 17 of Diemo Schwarz's thesis (available <A HREF=
"http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/analyse-synthese/schwarz/thesis/"
TARGET="_blank">here</A>).
