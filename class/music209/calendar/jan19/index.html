<h2>Introduction</h2>

<P>
This year's course will concentrate on current research in
concatenative sound synthesis and related topics.  Concatenative
synthesis methods stitch together segmented units of sound to produce
the desired output.  Concatenative synthesis has been successful as a
method for high-quality speech synthesis and holds considerable
promise for musical sound synthesis.

<P>
<A HREF="http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/analyse-synthese/schwarz/"
TARGET="_blank">Diemo Schwarz</A> popularized the term
<I>concatenative synthesis</I>.  His <A
HREF="http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/analyse-synthese/schwarz/publications/icmc2005/Schwarz_ICMC2005_Current-Research.pdf"
TARGET="_blank">review paper</A> is a good introduction to the
topic.  His <A HREF= "http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/analyse-synthese/schwarz/thesis/" 
TARGET="_blank">Ph. D. thesis</A> is a more complete description of his
work in the area.

<H2>Piano</H2>

<P>
The lecture begins with a description of using concatenative synthesis
for accurate piano synthesis.  See this <A
HREF="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Oct02/articles/synthsecrets10.asp"
TARGET="_blank">article</A> in the magazine Sound on Sound for a good
instruction to the physics of a piano.  Two good articles on how to
record a piano in the recording studio appear <A
HREF="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may99/articles/recpiano.htm"
TARGET="_blank">here</A> and <A
HREF="http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_killer_keys/"
TARGET="_blank">here</A>.

<P>
In class, we describe one sample set for grand piano, the Black Piano,
in detail.  Read a review of Black Piano <A
HREF="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/apr05/articles/sampleshop.htm#2"
TARGET="_blank">here</A> and listen to mp3s of the samples from links
available <A
HREF="http://www.bigfishaudio.com/4DCGI/detailDemos.html?1132"
TARGET="_blank">here</A> (scroll down to reach mp3 links).  Another
grand piano software product with similar aims is reviewed <A
HREF="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/mar05/articles/synthogyivory.htm"
TARGET="_blank">here.</A>

<P>
Concatenative piano synthesis was originally developed for hardware
piano products.  The Kurzweil 250, released in 1984 and described <A
HREF="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb99/articles/kurzweilk250.668.htm"
TARGET="_blank">here</A>, was the first piano product of this nature
that sounded convincing.  Good examples of modern hardware piano
products are the Roland, Yamaha, Technics, and Casio product lines.
Browse this <A
HREF="http://music.yamaha.com:80/products/category.html?groupId=18"
TARGET="_blank">web page</A> for a sense of the breadth of the Yamaha
product line in this area.

<H2>Strings</H2>

<P>
The lecture then discussed several products for solo violin
concatenative synthesis: the <A
HREF="http://www.vsl.co.at/en-us/65/71/214.vsl" TARGET="_blank">
Vienna Symphonic Library</A>, <A
HREF="http://www.garritan.com/stradivari.html"
TARGET="_blank">Garritan Stradivari</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.synful.com/" TARGET="_blank">Synful</A>.  

<P>
We listened to a Garritan version of the <A
HREF="http://northernsounds.com/forum/showthread.php?t=41257"
TARGET="_blank">Paganini Capriccio</A>, and to <A
HREF="http://www.donnewmeyer.com/cd3/cd3/files/Those_Who_Mourn.mp3"></A>track
</A> that combined an acoustic cello with a Synful violin
(see this <A
HREF="http://www.bigbluelounge.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=27682"
TARGET="_blank">discussion</A> for more information).

<H2>Saxophone</H2>

<P>
We concluded the first-half of the lecture with an introduction to
phrase-based synthesis, by discussing Liquid Saxophone.
Demos and
information of this product are available <A HREF="http://www.ueberschall.com/index.php?id=showproduct&user_uschall_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=61&type=1"
TARGET="_blank">here</A>.  More information about horn synthesis
is available on the course <A
HREF="../../projects/horns/index.html" TARGET="_blank">project page</A>
for horns.
