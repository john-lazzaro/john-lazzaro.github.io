<P>
This lecture focused on database descriptors for level, loudness,
spectral shape, and pitch.  Much of the material was adapted from
Chapters 10 and 11 of Diemo Schwarz's Ph.D. (available <A HREF=
"http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/analyse-synthese/schwarz/thesis/"
TARGET="_blank">here</A>).  In particular, we recommend Chapter 10
(and its references) as good reading for spectral shape and
harmonicity metrics.

<P>
Part of the lecture described loudness models.  This recent <A
HREF="http://www.tcelectronic.com/media/skovenborg_2004_loudness_m.pdf"
TARGET="_blank">AES paper</A> evaluates a variety of loudness models
for use in musical material (one of the authors is from TC
Electronics, a professional audio equipment manufacturer).

<P>
Part of the lecture concerned pitch.  This review <A TARGET="_blank"
HREF="http://www.pa.msu.edu/acoustics/tutorial.pdf"> paper</A> by
William Hartmann is a good introduction to pitch perception.  This <A
HREF="http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/~pdelac/154/m154paper.htm"
TARGET="_blank">review article</A> by Patricio de la Cuadra is a good
introduction to engineering approaches to pitch tracking.
