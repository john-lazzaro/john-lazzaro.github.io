We began the lecture by defining what an ideal pitch shifting
algorithm should do (see slides for details).  We then showed some
tutorial material on the mathematics of scales: this <A
HREF="http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52470.html"
TARGET="_blank">webpage</A> aimed at high school students covers scale
basics in a (very!) unintimidating way.

<P>
We then covered the basics of the psychoacoustics of pitch perception.
This interactive <A TARGET="_blank"
HREF="http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wtutor?tutorial=pitch">tutorial</A>
is a good way to learn more about the ideas presented in class.  For
more advanced material, see this

<P>
This part of the talk also included a slide on the pitch properties of
bell sounds.  This <A TARGET="_blank"
HREF="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Aug02/articles/synthsecrets0802.asp">article</A>
is a good introduction to synthesizing bell sounds, and includes the
spectral plot I showed in class.

<P>
We then discussed signal processing algorithms for pitch shifting.  A
good tutorial on these algorithms (the time-domain algorithms
presented in class, and also spectral algorithms which we will cover
later in the course) is available here ( [<A TARGET="_blank"

This part of the talk also included slides on the spectral properties
of instruments.  This <A TARGET="_blank"
HREF="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/mar01/articles/synthsec.asp">article</A>
is a good conceptual introduction to formants in sound synthesis.

<P>
We ended the first part of the lecture by reviewing the vocal project
ideas described <A HREF="../../projects/vocals/index.html"
