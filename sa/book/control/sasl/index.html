<P>
SASL (pronounced "sassil") is the score language for MP4-SA. 

<P>
A SASL score is an unordered list of SASL commands. A SASL command
performs a single action at a moment in time, such as changing the
value of a SAOL variable or creating a new instance of a SAOL
instrument.

<P>
The three examples in the <A HREF="../../tut/index.html">tutorial</A>
in Part I introduce most of the SASL commands. The right panel has
direct links to the examples.

<P>
In this chapter, we explain how a SASL score interacts with a SAOL
program, and describe the five types of SASL commands. We also discuss
the use of SASL commands in streaming and real-time applications of
MP4-SA.

<P>
A SAOL program executes by moving a simulated clock forward in time,
performing calculations along the way in a synchronous fashion.  A
SASL score is a list of commands that trigger actions relative to the
clock time. 

<P>
SASL commands are one line long. The newline marks the end of the
command.

<P>
A SASL command is a list of elements, separated by spaces
(and for some parts of some commands, colons). These elements may be
floating-point nunbers, SAOL and SASL keywords, and the instrument and
variable names from the companion SAOL program.

<P>
SASL commands in a score file need not appear in order of execution.
The trigger time of commands in a SASL score indicate the order that
the commands are executed.  The first number on a SASL command line
indicates indicates the trigger time for the command.

<P>
A SASL score may span several ASCII files.  MP4-SA tools concatenate
the score files and execute each SASL command at the appropriate time.

<P>
A SAOL program processes SASL commands at k-rate granularity. It
compares the simulated clock value with the trigger times of SASL
commands, and runs unexecuted commands that have a trigger time 
less than or equal to the current clock value.

<P>
The simulated clock has units of seconds, while command trigger time
has units of beats. At each k-pass, trigger times are converted from
beats to seconds, using the current value of the global tempo.

<P>
The global tempo has a default value of 60 beats per minute, or one
beat per second. The core opcode <A HREF=
"../../saol/simple/index.html#tempo">settempo</A> lets SAOL
instruments change the tempo value, and the tempo command lets a SASL
score change the tempo.

<P>
In the following sections, we describe the semantics of the SASL
commands. In Part III/3, we present a <A
HREF="../saolc/index.html#order">table</A> that shows the exact
execution order of these commands in a SAOL simulation.

<H2><A NAME="instr">Instr Command</A></H2>

<P>
The SASL <B>instr</B> command creates a new instance of a SAOL
instrument. The right panel shows the syntax of the command.

<H4>Syntax</H4>

<P>
An <B>instr</B> command optionally begins with a label. The SASL
<B>control</B> command uses this label to reference the instance.  The
label name must obey the <A HREF="../../saol/vars/index.html#names">
naming</A> rules described in Part II/1. Multiple <B>instr</B>
commands may use the same label name.

<P>
The first required element is the trigger time. The trigger time is a
floating-point value, in units of beats, that indicates when to create
the instance.

<P>
The trigger time is followed by the name of the SAOL instrument to
instantiate. Following the name is a floating-point duration value
that indicates how long the instance should execute.

<P>
The command ends with a list of floating-point values for initializing
the instrument parameters of the new instance.

<H4>Semantics</H4>

<P>
When a SASL <B>instr</B> command triggers, it creates an instance
of the specified SAOL instrument. See the <A HREF="#sasl">previous
section</A> for details on when a SASL command triggers.

<P>
The instrument parameters of the new instance are set to the
initialization values specified by the command. If the command has too
few values, the remaining instrument parameters are set to
zero.

<P>
If the duration value is <TT>-1</TT>, the instance executes
indefinitely. Otherwise, the duration value indicates how long the
instrument should execute, in units of beats.

<P>
At the start of each k-pass, a termination time is computed, by using
the global tempo to convert the duration value from beats to seconds,
and adding this value to the creation time of the instance.

<P>
If this termination time is less than or equal to the current clock
time, the instance is scheduled for termination at the end of the
current execution cycle.

<P>
A <A HREF= "../saolc/index.html#order">table</A> in Part II/3 shows
the timing of instance creation and termination in an orchestra cycle.

<P>
The SASL <B>control</B> command changes the value of a SAOL
variable. The right panel shows the syntax of the <B>control</B>
command.

<H4>Syntax</H4>

<P>
The command begins with the trigger time, that indicates when to
change the value of the SAOL variable.

<P>
The trigger time is followed by an optional label element, that refers
to instances created by labelled SASL <B>instr</B> commands. The label
name must obey the <A HREF="../../saol/vars/index.html#names">
naming</A> rules described in Part II/1.

<P>
Following the keyword <B> control</B> is the name of the SAOL variable
to change, and the new floating-point value for the variable.

<H4>Semantics</H4>

<P>
When a <B>control</B> command triggers, it changes the value of a SAOL
variable. 

<P>
The command has different semantics, depending on the
presence of the optional label element. 

<P>
If no label is present, the command changes the SAOL global 
variable with the specified name to the new value. Both
i-rate and k-rate global variables may be targeted.

<P>
If a label is present, then all instances created by SASL <B>instr</B>
commands with that label are examined. If an instance has an
<B>imports</B> variable with the specified name, the command changes
the variable to the new value. 

<P>
Variables targeted by labelled <B>control</B> commands must be
k-rate. Variables in user-defined opcodes are not reachable by
labelled control commands.

<H2><A NAME="table">Table Command</A></H2>

<P>
The SASL <B>table</B> command acts to create wavetables in a SAOL
program. The right panel shows the syntax of a <B>table</B> command.

<H4>Syntax</H4>

<P>
The command begins with the trigger time, that indicates when to
create the SAOL table.

<P>
The keyword <B>table</B> is followed the name of the wavetable to
create, and the wavetable generator for initializing the table. The
specified generator must be one of the SAOL <A
HREF="../../saol/wave/index.html#decl">wavetable generators</A>, or
the special keyword <B>destroy</B>.

<P>
The command ends with a list of parameters to supply
to the wavetable generator.

<H4>Semantics</H4>

<P>
The <B>table</B> command specifies a SAOL wavetable.  When the command
triggers, this SAOL wavetable is changed as described below.

<P>
If this wavetable is a global wavetable in the SAOL program, the
contents of this wavetable are replaced by a new wavetable.  The new
wavetable is created by the specified generator, which is run using
the specified parameters.

<P>
If the wavetable generator element is specified as the
keyword <B>destroy</B>, the current contents of the wavetable are
destroyed, and can no longer be accessed by the SAOL program.

<P>
The <A HREF= "../saolc/index.html#order">table</A> in Part II/3 shows
the timing of <B>table</B> commands during an orchestra cycle.

<H4>Future Tables</H4>

<P>
As we <A HREF="../../saol/wave/index.html#decl">described</A> in Part
II/4, a SAOL instrument may declare a wavetable as <B>imports
table</B> even if no global wavetable exists with the same name.

<P>
If the wavetable specified in the <B>table</B> command is not a global
wavetable, the wavetable is created as a new global wavetable, or
<I>future</I> wavetable. 

<P>
The wavetable is created by the specified generator, which is run
using the specified parameters.

<P>
Once the future wavetable is created, calls to instruments that import
the table may legally execute, with semantics identical to global
tables.

<H2><A NAME="stream">Streaming and SASL</A></H2>

<P>
In the examples in the <A HREF="../../tut/index.html">tutorial</A> in
Part I, an ASCII file contains all the SASL commands for a
performance.  Some of these examples use <TT>sfront</TT> to create a
binary encoding of the SAOL and SASL files. This program places all
the SASL commands at the start of the file, and encodes the trigger
times for all commands.

<P>
A binary MP4 encoding that has SASL commands distributed throughout
the file is a better match for some applications.  For example, an
application for real-time audio streaming over a slow computer network
could benefit from distributed SASL commands. In this case, SASL
commands occuring later in the performance are not needed immediately,
and may be postponed without affecting the audio output.

<P>
The MP4 binary file format has provisions for distributed SASL
commands. Trigger times are optional for these commands, to support
efficient encoding for real-time streaming applications over a
low-latency network.

<P>
Distributed commands <I>without</I> timestamps are executed at the
next opportunity for executing commands of its type in the <A
HREF="../saolc/index.html#order">execution order</A>.  Distributed
commands <I>with</I> timestamps follow the trigger semantics described
in an <A HREF="#sasl">earlier section</A> in this chapter.

<H4>Real-time Flags</H4>

<P>
Several flags may be added to SASL commands for real-time
applications. A "*" may be added to each command, indicating that the
command is a "high-priority" event that should be executed even if CPU
cycles are scarce.

<P>
A "use-if-late" flag may also be added to the binary encoding of a
distributed SASL command, that instructs the decoder to execute a
command even if latency problems result in an MP4 data stream falling
"out of sync" with real-time.
