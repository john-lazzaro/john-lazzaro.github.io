<H2><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H2>

<P>
In the previous chapters in Part III, we describe the SASL and MIDI
commands that create and control instrument instances.  In this
chapter, we describe SAOL statements that support instrument control.

<P>
We describe the SAOL <B>instr</B> statement, that supports dynamic
instance creation. An algorithmic score generator may be written
directly in SAOL using this statement.

<P>
We describe several SAOL standard names for status monitoring that are
useful for algorithmic score generation.  

<P>
These standard names hold information such as the elapsed time since
instantiation, and whether an instrument is scheduled to be terminated
before the next k-pass.

<P>
We describe several SAOL statements that let instances change their
status. The <B>turnoff</B> statement lets an instance schedule its
termination, while the <B>extend</B> statement lets an instance delay
its termination.

<P>
Finally, we present a chart that shows the complete execution timeline
of a SAOL program.  

<P>
The timeline shows the order of events during
program startup, as well as the sequencing of events during an
orchestra cycle of i-pass, k-pass, and a-pass.

<H2><A NAME="instr">Dynamic Instruments</A></H2>

<P>
The SAOL <B>instr</B> statement performs dynamic instrument
instantiation, so that a parent instrument may spawn copies of a child
instrument. This statement supports applications such as sequencers,
arpeggiators, and algorithmic composition.

<P>
The <B>instr</B> statement runs at the i-rate or the k-rate, and may
not be used in the <B>global</B> block. The right panel shows the
syntax for the SAOL <B>instr</B> statement.

<P>
The statement syntax begins with the keyword <B>instr</B>, followed by
the name of the child instrument to instantiate.

<P>
The parameters are i-rate or k-rate scalar expressions that control
the instantiation process. All expressions evaluate to constant values
before the child instrument spawns.

<P>
The <TT>dly</TT> and <TT>dur</TT> parameters control the starting time
and duration for the new instance.  

<P>
The remaining parameters (<TT>p1, p2 ...</TT>) are the initial values
for the instrument parameters of the new instance. The number of
<TT>p</TT> parameters must match the number of instrument parameters
in the new instance.

<H4> <TT>dly</TT> and <TT>dur</TT> </H4>

<P>
The <TT>dur</TT> parameter specifies how long (in scorebeats) the
instance should execute before terminating. If <TT>dur</TT> has a
value of <TT>-1</TT>, the instance runs indefinitely.

<P>
The <TT>dly</TT> parameter specifies the length of time (in scorebeats)
to delay the instantiation of the new instrument.

<P>
If the <TT>dly</TT> parameter has a value less than the k-period
(<TT>1/k_rate</TT>) the instrument is created as soon as the
<B>instr</B> statement executes. The i-pass of the new instance is run
immediately, and the following rules hold for the first k-pass and
a-pass of the new instance:

<UL>
<LI>
If the instanced instrument occurs earlier in the <A
HREF="../../saol/bus/index.html#determine">execution order</A> than
the instrument containing the <B>instr</B> statement, the first k-pass
and a-pass for the new instance are <I>delayed</I> until the
<I>next</I> orchestra cycle.
<LI>
If the instanced instrument does not occur earlier, the k-pass and
a-pass of the new instance run in the <I>current</I> cycle.
</UL>

<P> 
If the <TT>dly</TT> parameter of the <B>instr</B> statement has a
value greater than or equal to the k-period, the new instance is not
created immediately. 

<P> 
Instead, a start time (in scorebeats) is computed for the new
instance, by adding the <TT>dly</TT> parameter to the current score
time. The instance is created when the score time exceeds this start
time.

<H4> Rate Semantics </H4>

<P>
The <B>instr</B> statement may be an i-rate or a k-rate statement.  It
is an i-rate statement unless one of these conditions hold, in which
case it runs at k-rate:

<OL>
<LI> Any of its parameters are k-rate.
<LI> If the <B>instr</B> statement is enclosed in an <B>if</B>,
<B>if-else</B>, or <B>while</B> statement and the rate of the guard
expression of the enclosing statement is k-rate. It is an error if
this guard expression is a-rate. 
</OL>

<P>
The right panel shows examples of the rate semantics of the 
<B>instr</B> statement.

<H2><A NAME="stnames">Instrument Status</A></H2>

<P>
Five SAOL standard names let an instance monitor its execution
status. The right panel lists the full semantics for these standard
names.

<P>
These standard names work in instances generated using any MP4-SA
technique: SASL <B>instr</B> lines, SAOL <B>instr</B> and <B>send</B>
statements, and MIDI note-on commands. 

<P>


<H4><TT>time and itime</TT></H4>

<P>
The <B>time</B> standard name holds the creation time for the
instance, measured in seconds.  The <B>itime</B> standard name is the
elapsed time since the instance was created. See the right panel for
full semantics.

<P>
These two names support algorithmic scores, by letting an
instance track simulation time and dynamically create 
other instances at the appropriate times.


<H4><TT>dur</TT></H4>

<P>
The expected duration of the instance, in seconds. An indefinite
duration is indicated by -1. Although this standard name is an
<B>ivar</B>. its value changes during the life of the instance, as
explained on the right panel.

<H4><TT>released</TT></H4>

<P>
This standard name normally has a value of zero. If the instance is
slated to be terminated at the end of the next series of a-passes,
<B>released</B> takes on the value <TT>1</TT>.

<P>
The <B>released</B> standard name is often used in conjunction with
the <A HREF="#extend">extend</A> statement (covered later in this
chapter) to add a release phase to an instance created with a definite
duration.

<H4><TT>cpuload</TT></H4>

<P>
This standard name is intended for applications where real-time
decoding is needed, such as streaming audio to a D/A converter.

<P>
It tracks what percentage of system resources are currently being
used, scaled to the amount of resources needed to maintain real-time
operation. See the right panel for full semantics.

Zero seconds is start of simulation.
</PRE>
</TT>


<H2><TT>ksig itime;</TT></H2>
<TT>
<PRE>
The elapsed time since the instance
was created. In seconds, not 
scorebeats. Zero seconds is the
first k-pass. Note that (itime

absolute time.
</PRE>
</TT>


<H2><TT>ivar dur;</TT></H2>

The intended duration (in 
seconds, not scorebeats) of
the instrument, as set by
the duration parameter in the 
SAOL <B>instr</B> statement
or SASL <B>instr</B> command.

MIDI and <B>send</B> instances
always set dur to -1. SAOL and
SASL <B>instr</B> commands may also
set dur to -1. A -1 indicates
indefinite duration.

Although it is an ivar, the

Measures the load on the CPU
that this instance in running

<H2><A NAME="extend">The Extend Statement</A></H2>

<P>
An instance may delay its termination by executing the <B>extend</B>
statement.  This statement is often run in response to the setting of
the <B><A HREF="#stnames">released</A></B> standard name.

<P>
The right panel shows the syntax for the <B>extend</B> statement.  The
statement has a single parameter <TT>delay</TT>, an i-rate or k-rate
signed expression for the amount of time to extend or reduce the
instance (in seconds, not scorebeats).

<P>
If an instance has a scheduled termination time, executing the
<B>extend</B> statement adds the value of <TT>delay</TT> to that
termination time. If the new termination time is less than or equal to
the current simulation time, the <B>extend</B> acts like the <A
HREF="#turnoff"><B>turnoff</B></A> statement (described in the next
section).

<P>
If an instance has an indefinite termination time (i.e. a duration of
<TT>-1</TT>) executing the <B>extend</B> statement sets the new
termination time to be the current simulation time plus the value of
<TT>delay</TT>. If <TT>delay</TT> is less than or equal to zero, the
<B>extend</B> acts like the <A HREF="#turnoff"><B>turnoff</B></A>
statement.

<P>
The <B>dur</B> standard name is updated to reflect the execution
of the <B>extend</B> statement.

<P>
The <B>extend</B> statement may be an i-rate or a k-rate statement.  It
is an i-rate statement unless one of these conditions hold, in which
case it runs at k-rate:

k-rate statement.

<P>
The <B>turnoff</B> statement is particularly useful for instances that
are not scheduled for termination automatically, such as instances
created with the SASL <B>instr</B> command and the SAOL <B>instr</B>
statement with a duration of -1.
