<H2><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H2>

<P>
In this chapter, we show how to construct arithmetic and logical
expressions in SAOL. We also explain the SAOL statements for
assignment, conditional execution, and looping. 

<P>
We show how to determine the width and rate of SAOL expressions, and
how width and rate rules govern the use of expressions in SAOL
statements.

<P>
The rate rules we present in this book are sometimes more conservative
than those in the SAOL language specification.  We reformulated these
rules to make them easier to understand and remember.

<P>
We find that SAOL programs written using these rules are
easier to maintain, and often run faster as well.

<H2><A NAME="arith">Arithmetic Expressions</A></H2>

<P>
The simplest SAOL expressions use the basic arithmetic operations
(negation, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on
scalar signal variables and numbers. 

<P>
Negation is evaluated first in SAOL expressions, followed by
addition and subtraction, and lastly multiplication and division. This
ordering forms three <I>precedence</I> classes: unary <TT>-</TT>,
binary (<TT>+</TT>, <TT>-</TT>), and binary (<TT>*</TT>, <TT>/</TT>).

<P>
For the binary classes, operators are performed in the order they
appear in an expression, scanning from left to right. For the unary
class, operators are performed in order scanning from right to left.
Parenthesis act to change this ordering. 

<P>
These precedence and scanning order rules are identical to the C
language. The right panel shows examples of correct evaluation.

<P>
Unlike C, all numbers and variables in SAOL expressions are 32-bit
floating point values. As a result, the type conversion issues in
evaluating C expressions aren't needed. An example on the right panel
show a consequence of this distinction.

<P>
All unary and binary operations in SAOL follow a simple rate rule: the
rate of an expression is the rate of its fastest subexpression (i-rate
is the slowest rate, k-rate is a faster rate, and a-rate is the
fastest rate). 

<P>
If a subexpression is an atomic element (a <A
HREF="../vars/index.html#vars_instr">variable</A>, <A
HREF="../vars/index.html#preamble"><B>instr</B> parameter</A>, <A
HREF="../vars/index.html#stnames">standard name</A>, or <A
HREF="../vars/index.html#numbers">number</A>) the rate of the
subexpressions is the rate of the atomic element.

<H2><A NAME="array">Arrays and Expressions</A></H2>

<P>
In Part II/1, we described how to <A HREF=
"../vars/index.html#vars_instr">declare</A> array signal variables.
In this section, we describe how to use arrays in arithmetic
expressions.

<P>
Like C arrays, arrays in SAOL may be indexed to access a single value
in an array, using square bracket syntax. See the right panel for
examples.

<P>
SAOL array indexes are numbered starting with 0 and can take on values
up to <TT>N - 1</TT>, where <TT>N</TT> is the declared width of an
array. The index value is a scalar SAOL expression. 

<P>
The index expression is evaluated to a 32-bit floating point value,
then rounded to the nearest integer to produce the index position.
Rounding is performed by adding <TT>0.5</TT> to the index value and
truncating the result.

<P>
Indexed arrays in SAOL are scalars. The rate of an indexed array is
either the declared rate of the array itself, or the rate of the
indexing expression, whichever is faster. The panel on the right
shows examples of indexed arrays in SAOL expressions.

<P>
Arrays in SAOL are different from C arrays in one significant way: an
unindexed array may be used in an expression. 

<P>
One simple way to use arrays in SAOL arithmetic expressions is for
all atomic elements be array variables of the same width
<TT>N</TT>. In this case, the expression is evaluated as in the scalar
case, for each position in the array. The final result has width
<TT>N</TT>. See the right panel for an example.

<P>
Expressions between a scalar and a width <TT>N</TT> array are also
supported in SAOL. For a binary operator, the scalar is promoted to
an array of width <TT>N</TT> that takes on the scalar value for all
elements, and the operation proceeds as an array operation.

<P>
Operations between two arrays of different widths are prohibited (note
we consider arrays of width 1 as scalars in this context). See the
right panel for legal and illegal array expressions.

<P>
The rate semantics for array expressions are identical to scalar
expressions.

<H2><A NAME="logic">Logical Expressions</A></H2>

<P>
SAOL provides <I>relational</I> operators for comparing signal
variables and <I>logical</I> operators for doing Boolean algebra on a
binary interpretation of signal variables. 

<P>
Like arithmetic expressions, the rate of relational and logical
operators is the rate of the fastest subexpression. Apart from the
<TT>&&</TT> and <TT>||</TT> operators (see below) the width semantics
are also identical to arithmetic expressions.

<P>
SAOL has six relational operators (less than, greater than, less than
or equal to, greater than or equal to, equal to, not equal to) that
use the same symbols as C (<TT>< > <= >= == !=</TT>). If an operator
is true, it takes the value 1.0. If it is false, it takes the value
0.0.

<P> 
SAOL has three logical operators that implement the Boolean AND, OR,
and NOT functions.  SAOL logical operators interpret the
floating-point value 0.0 as false, and all other values as true.

<P> 
The unary NOT operator <TT>!</TT> performs logical negation on a
signal variable, mapping 0.0 to 1.0 and all other values to 0.0.

<P> 
The binary logical operators <TT>&&</TT> and <TT>||</TT> perform the
logical AND and OR operations. The semantics of these operators depend
on the width of their operand subexpressions.  If at least one
subexpression has a width greater than one, the left and right
subexpressions are both evaluated, and the operator is applied as
usual.

<P>
However, if both operands are scalar width, the <TT>&&</TT> and <TT>||</TT>
operators take on the <I>short-circuit</I> semantics of their C
language equivalents. For AND, if the left subexpression evaluates to
false, the right subexpression is not evaluated, and the result of the
AND operation is set to 0.0. Only if the left subexpression evaluates
to true is the right subexpression evaluated.

<P>
Likewise, for the logical OR operator with scalar width operands, if the
left subexpression evaluates to true, the right subexpression is not
evaluated, and the result of the OR operation is set to 1.0.  Only if
the left subexpression evaluates to false is the right subexpression
evaluated.

<P>
Apart from the short-circuit behavior, width semantics of <TT>&&</TT>
and <TT>||</TT> are identical to arithmetic operators.

<H2><A NAME="switch">Switch</A></H2>

<P>
The SAOL switch operator (see right panel for syntax) has both logical
and arithmetic properties.  If the logical value of the first operand
is non-zero (logical true) the switch operator takes the value of the
second operand, else it takes the value of the third operand.

<P>
The rate of the switch operator is the rate of the fastest of its
three operands. As shown in the table in the last section, the
precedence of the switch operator is the lowest of all SAOL operators.

<P>
The exact semantics of the switch operator depend on the width of its
subexpression operands. If its operands all have scalar width, the
operator has short circuit semantics. The first subexpressions is
always evaluated, and depending on its logical value, either the
second or the third subexpression is evaluated (but never both).

<P>
However, if at least one subexpression has width greater than 1,
all three subexpressions are evaluated, and then the operator
logic happens on an element-by-element basis. 

<P>
Apart from the short-circuit behavior, width semantics are identical
to arithmetic operators.

<P>
The switch operand concludes our tour of the SAOL operators.  The C
operators that are missing from SAOL are those that target integer
data types, such as bit shifts, bit-wise logic, and modulo. In
addition, SAOL expressions may not have embedded assignments to
variables within them, unlike C expressions.

<H2><A NAME="assign">Assignment Statement</A></H2>

<P>
In this chapter, we describe the three SAOL statements that are the core
tools for expressing algorithms. We begin with the assignment
statement that sets a signal variable to a new value.

<P>
The panel on the right shows the syntax of the assignment statement.
The <I>lval</I> is the <B>instr</B> parameter or signal variable that
receives the new value. The <I>expr</I> is the expression that is
evaluated to generate the value to assign.

<P>
An <I>lval</I> may be a scalar or array variable, and so assignment
statements also have rules regarding width semantics.

<P>
If the <I>lval</I> has scalar width (i.e. it is a scalar, an array of width
1, or an indexed array), the expression must also have scalar width.
Indexed array <I>lval</I>s follow the rate, width, and indexing <A
HREF="#array">rules</A> for indexed arrays in expressions.

<P>
If the <I>lval</I> is an unindexed array of width <TT>N</TT>, the
expression must either have width <TT>N</TT> or scalar width (in which
case each element of the <I>lval</I> takes on the scalar value).

<P>
See the right panel for examples showing the width semantics of
assignment statements.


<P>
If the <I>lval</I> and <I>expr</I> both have width greater than one,
SAOL leaves the sequence order of expression evaluation and assignment
undefined. One implementation may evaluate the expression for all
array elements before doing the assignment; a second implementation
may evaluate and assign array elements member by member, in an
arbitrary order.

<P>
This implementation detail matters to the SAOL programmer, because it
is possible to write assignment statements whose answer depends on the
sequence of operations, by using indexed versions of the <I>lval</I>
variable in the <I>expr</I>. Reliable SAOL programs break up this sort
of assignment statement into several simpler statements.

<P>
Assignment statements have two rate rules:

<OL>
<LI>
<B>
The rate of the </B><I>lval</I><B> sets the rate for the 
assignment statement.</B> For example, if the <I>lval</I> is a-rate,
the expression is evaluated and the <I>lval</I> is set to a new value
during every a-pass. This is true even if the expression is k-rate or
i-rate.</LI>
<LI>
<P>
<B>
The rate of the expression may not be faster than the rate of the</B>
<I>lval</I>.  For example, if the <I>lval</I> is k-rate, the
expression may not be a-rate.</LI>
</OL>

<P>
These rules underpin the SAOL multi-pass compute model described in
the <A HREF = "../../tut/index.html#execution">tutorial</A> in Part
I. The first rule establishes the convention for setting the rate of
variable assignments. The second rule forces information to flow from
slower-rate variables to faster-rate variables.

<P>
SAOL also has a null variant of the assignment statement, in which an
expression is computed but not assigned to an <I>lval</I>. The null
assignment statement runs at the rate of the expression.

<P> 
The <B>if</B> and <B>if-else</B> statements support conditional
execution. The right panel shows the syntax for these statements.

<P> 
These conditional statements work as follows.  If the guard expression
<I>expr</I> of an <B>if</B> statement is non-zero (logical true) the
statement block is executed.

<P> 
The <B>if-else</B> statement adds a second statement block that is
executed if <I>expr</I> is zero (logical false).

<P>
Unlike C, the curly braces surrounding the statement blocks in the
SAOL <B>if</B> and <B>if-else</B> statements are required, 
regardless of the number of statements in the block.

<P> 
The guard expression must have scalar width. The short-circuit
semantics of the scalar-width <TT>&&</TT>, <TT>||</TT>, and switch
operators are useful for constructing efficient guard expressions.

<P> 
The <B>if</B> and <B>if-else</B> statements have four rate rules.
The first two rules are simple to state:

<OL>
<LI>
The rate of the <B>if</B> or <B>if-else</B> statement is the rate of
the fastest statement in the statement block(s) it controls.
<LI>
No statement in the statement block(s) may be slower than the 
guard expression.
</OL>

<P> 
Rule 1 sets a simple convention for setting the rate of the <B>if</B>
or <B>if-else</B> statement. Rule 2 lets slower-rate variables
conditionally control the execution of faster-rate statements.

<P>
The right panel shows an example of an <B>if-else</B> statement, whose
behavior may be understood using these two rate rules.

<H4>Multi-rate semantics</H4>

<P>
Note that rate Rules 1 and 2 permit multi-rate <B>if</B> and
<B>if-else</B> statements. For example, a k-rate <B>if</B> statement
with an i-rate guard may include i-rate statements in its
statement block.


<P>
We recommend avoiding multi-rate statement blocks, since the resulting
code is difficult to maintain. However, because this construction is
legal, you may encounter it in SAOL code. Rate rules 3 and 4 cover
this construction:

<OL START=3>
<LI>
If i-rate statements appear in a statement block of a k-rate or a-rate
<B>if</B> or <B>if-else</B> statement, the i-rate statements execute
at most once, during the first time the statement block executes. The
i-rate statements execute at this start of statement block execution,
before any k-rate or a-rate statements run.
<LI>
If k-rate statements appear in a statement block of an a-rate
<B>if</B> or <B>if-else</B> statement, the k-rate statements execute
at most once per execution cycle, during the first a-pass the
statement block executes.  The k-rate statements execute at this start
of statement block execution, before any a-rate statements run.

<P> 
The <B>while</B> statement is the only looping construct in SAOL.  See
the right panel for the statement syntax.  

<P>
The curly braces surrounding the statement block are required,
regardless of the number of statements in the block.

<P> 
At the start of <B>while</B> statement execution, the guard expression
<I>expr</I> is evaluated. If it has a value of zero (logical false)
the statement ends.

<P>
However if <I>expr</I> is non-zero (logical true) the program flow
alternates between executing the statement block and re-evaluating
<I>expr</I>. The <B>while</B> statement ends the first time
<I>expr</I> evaluates to false.

<P>
The guard <I>expr</I> must have scalar width.

<P> 
The <B>while</B> statement obeys a single rate rule:

<OL>
<LI>
The guard expression and all statements in the block must run
at the same rate. This rate becomes the rate of the <B>while</B>
statement.
</OL>

<P>
The right panel shows an example of a <B>while</B> statement. The
statement block executes 50 times per k-pass.

<P>
In this chapter, we have presented the core language
tools for expressing algorithms. Compared to a 
language like C, the number of constructs may seem
small.

<P>
The SAOL toolkit is limited because there is so much information to
remember about each construct: program semantics, width semantics, and
rate semantics. Three core statement types is a manageable number to
remember how to use, while 6 or 7 might not be.

<P>
The right panel collects the rate semantic rules we have presented in
this chapter.

<H2>Rate Rules</H2>
<H4>Expressions</H4>

<OL>
<LI>
The rate of an expression (as described in this chapter) is the rate
of its fastest atomic element.
</OL>
</B>

<H4>Assignment Statement</H4>

<OL>
<LI>
The rate of the <I>lval</I> sets the rate for the assignment
statement.
<LI>
The rate of the expression may not be faster than the rate of the
<I>lval</I>.  
</OL>

<H4>Null Assignment Statement</H4>
<OL>
<LI>
The rate of the statement is the rate of the expression.
</OL>

<H4>If and If-Else Statements</H4>

<OL>
<LI>
The rate of the <B>if</B> or <B>if-else</B> statement is the rate of
the fastest statement in the statement block(s) it controls.
<LI>
No statement in the statement block(s) may be slower than the 
guard expression.
<LI>
If i-rate statements appear in a statement block of a k-rate or a-rate
<B>if</B> or <B>if-else</B> statement, the i-rate statements execute
at most once, during the first time the statement block executes. The
i-rate statements execute at this start of statement block execution,
before any k-rate or a-rate statements run.
<LI>
If k-rate statements appear in a statement block of an a-rate
<B>if</B> or <B>if-else</B> statement, the k-rate statements execute
at most once per execution cycle, during the first a-pass the
statement block executes.  The k-rate statements execute at this start
of statement block execution, before any a-rate statements run.
</OL>

<H4>While Statement</H4>
<OL>
<LI>
The guard expression and all statements in the block must run
at the same rate. This rate becomes the rate of the <B>while</B>
statement.
