<P>
Several sfront command-line options let the user specify control
information in a static way.  The <A
HREF="../../../user/cmdline/index.html#sco"><TT>-sco</TT></A> and <A
HREF="../../../user/cmdline/index.html#sstr"><TT>-sstr</TT></A> command
line options let user specify SASL commands in an ASCII file, and the
<A HREF="../../../user/cmdline/index.html#midi"><TT>-midi</TT></A> and <A
HREF="../../../user/cmdline/index.html#mstr"><TT>-mstr</TT></A> options
let users specify MIDI commands via standard MIDI files. Both SASL and
MIDI commands may be a part of <TT>mp4</TT> binary files, which are
specified by the <A HREF="../../../user/cmdline/index.html#bit"><TT>-bit</TT></A> and <A HREF="../../../user/cmdline/index.html#bit"><TT>-bitc</TT></A> options.

<P>
When any of these options are specified, sfront transforms the control
information into initialization parameters for C global variables in
the <TT>sa.c</TT> file. A static compilation approach lets the C 
compiler optimize the <TT>sa.c</TT> program in significant ways.

<P>
However, for some applications, a static approach to SASL and MIDI
control data is not suitable. An important example is streaming
Structured Audio files over the Internet. The <TT>mp4</TT> file format
lets users place the SASL and MIDI control information in small
packets (called <TT>SA_access_units</TT>) at the end of the file (see
this <A HREF="../../../user/use/index.html#encode">section</A> of the
manual to learn how to encode control information into
SA_access_units). A Structured Audio decoder that can accept control
data dynamically can start playing back an <TT>mp4</TT> file once a
few <TT>SA_access_units</TT>s are received, rather than wait for the
entire file to arrive.

<P>
The <I>control driver</I> interface is designed to support dynamic
control applications such as audio streaming. The interface lets the
user specify a C or C++ driver file to be included into the main
<TT>sa.c</TT> file, that is capable of dynamically issuing SASL and
MIDI commands at each k-cycle. In addition to providing functionality
for normatively streaming Structured Audio, the control driver
interface also has facilities for supporting interactive applications
such as patch editors, sequencers, and hardware emulations.

<P>
Our description of control drivers is divided into three sections.
In this section, we introduce the control driver architecture by
describing the streaming file control driver <TT>fstr</TT> that is
included in the sfront distribution. The second and third sections
describe the control driver interface in detail.

<P>
The right panel shows how to use sfront to stream a Structured Audio
binary file that has control information encoded as
<TT>SA_access_unit</TT>s. The example uses the file streaming control
driver <TT>fstr</TT>. In this section, we will use <TT>fstr</TT> to
introduce the control driver concept.

<P>
The control driver <TT>fstr</TT> is invoked on the sfront command line
by using the option <TT>-cin fstr</TT>. This option copies the C or
C++ code contained in the file <TT>sfront/src/lib/csys/fstr.c</TT>
into the <TT>sa.c</TT> file created by sfront.

<P>
Like all control drivers, the <TT>fstr</TT> control driver defines
a small number of C functions, listed on the right panel.  These
functions are called at different points during the execution of the
<TT>sa.c</TT> program:

<UL>
<LI>
<B>csys_setup(void)</B> Called at the start
of execution of the <TT>sa.c</TT> program, lets the
control driver initialize its state. 
<LI>
<B>csys_newdata(void)</B> Called once per <A
HREF="../../../../book/tut/index.html#execution">control cycle</A>
(k-cycle). Its return value informs the main program that there are
MIDI or SASL events that the driver wishes to execute this cycle.
<LI>
<B>csys_midievent(...)</B> Called if the
csys_newdata() return value indicates that the driver 
wishes to send MIDI events. The actual MIDI event is 
returned using pointer variables in the function parameter
list. The return value is used to request another call to
csys_midievent(), to transfer another MIDI event in the
same k-cycle.
<LI>
<B>csys_saslevent(...)</B> Called if the
csys_newdata() return value indicates that the driver 
wishes to send SASL events. The actual SASL event is 
returned using pointer variables in the function parameter
list. The return value is used to request another call to
csys_saslevent(), to transfer another SASL event in the
same k-cycle. The csys_saslevent() function may also
be used to send <I>special events</I> that perform 
functions not included in the SASL language.
<LI>
<B>csys_shutdown(void)</B> Called at the end of execution of the
<TT>sa.c</TT> program, lets the control driver close files and
devices. If the <TT>-except</TT> option is used during sfront
invocation, csys_shutdown() will be called even if the <TT>sa.c</TT>
program is ending its execution prematurely due to an error condition.
</UL>

<P>
In order to request MIDI and SASL events, the control
driver needs to know details about the SAOL file, such
as the names of instruments and variables. The
next section of the control driver chapter
describes the data structures and service functions 
that inform the SAOL program and the run-time environment.

<P>
The final section of the control driver chapter describes the calling
syntax and semantics for the five functions listed above. It also
describes the registration process, by which the sfront program learns
the characteristics of a new control driver.

<H2>Example</H2>


<TT>
<pre>
sfront -cin fstr -bitc t.mp4 
       -aout linux -playback
gcc -O3 sa.c -o sa
./sa


Notes:

[1] The control driver is 
specified by "-cin fstr"

[2] We use -bitc instead of
-bit to tell sfront to not
compile in the SA_access_unit
data into sa.c.

[3] We use -aout linux -playback
to tell sfront to send its audio
directly to the soundcard, instead
of its default behavior of writing
an output.wav file.
