<P>
Part II of the <TT>sfront</TT> reference manual is written for two
audiences:

<UL>
<LI>
People who are writing end-user audio applications, such as
sequencers, sound design tools, and streaming audio clients, and who want
to use sfront instead of writing a Structured Audio decoder
themselves.
<LI>
People who are using sfront directly as a command-line tool,
and want to add new functions to the program, such as audio
output support for an unsupported operating system.
</UL>

<P>
In this chapter, we introduce both audiences to developing code for
sfront. We begin with a description of how to use the off-the-shelf
sfront in simple end-user applications, and show the limits
of this approach. 

<P>
We then introduce the <I>driver interface,</I> a mechanism for adding
application-specific code to sfront. The driver interface offers a
more flexible way for application developers to use sfront in their
programs. In addition, people wishing to add a new general-purpose
feature to sfront can often use the driver interface, instead of
directly modifying the sfront sources.

<P>
The chapter ends with a roadmap for the following two chapters,
which describe the driver interface in detail. These chapters
describe <I>control drivers</I>, which lets user C code directly
control the sound generation process, and <I>audio drivers</I>,
which handle moving audio-rate streams into and out of the sound
engine.

<P>
Some end-user applications have simple requirements for a
sound-generation engine. For example, consider a program
that is a graphical score editor, that lets users 
manually enter traditional music notation onto staves.

<P>
A common feature of score editors is an audio preview
function, that lets users listen to rendered versions
of the audio.  The right panel shows a C language code
fragment that implements the feature, for Linux systems.

<P>
The code on the right panel assumes that the application
program has created a SASL file <TT>ss</TT>, that contains
the notes values and durations from the graphical score in
SASL notation. 

<P>
The code also assumes that the program has created
a SAOL file, <TT>sl</TT>, to orchestrate the score. 
Typically, the application will have a library of SAOL 
programs available, and includes a user-interface for 
mapping different musical lines to SAOL instruments.

<P>
The code on the right panel uses the ANSI C library call
<TT>system()</TT> to execute other programs. As an 
ANSI library function, this method should work with any
ANSI-compliant C compiler. However, the commands to be
executed must exist on the platform.

<P>
Three programs are executed in sequence:

<OL>
<LI>
<TT>sfront</TT>. The generated SAOL and SASL files 
are converted into a C file (<TT>sa.c</TT>, the default
name). Note that the OS-specific audio driver <TT>linux</TT>
is used to specify streaming audio output. A multi-platform
application would substitute different drivers for each OS.
<LI>
<TT>gcc</TT>. Compiles the <TT>sa.c</TT> to create an 
executable. A multi-platform application would need to know
the standard compiler for each OS.
<LI>
<TT>sa</TT>. The executable that generates the audio.
</OL>

<P>
In practice, a production application would include additional code
for error checking and file management, as described on the right
panel.

<H2>Sample Code</H2>

<TT>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

/* application first generates */
/* file "sl" holding the SAOL  */
/* program, and file "ss"      */
/* holding the SASL notes.     */


/* run sfront on sl and ss */

system(
"sfront -aout linux -orc sl -sco ss"
);

/* compile sfront's output */

system("gcc -O3 sa.c -o sa");

/* run executable */

system("./sa");


</pre>
</TT>

<H2>In Production Code:</H2>

<TT>
<pre>
[1] Write all files to /tmp, use
    tempnam() to create unique names,
    and delete files after use.

[2] Examine return value of system()
    call for errors. 

[3] Use POSIX and Windows replacements
    for system() for enhanced features.

[4] Redirect stdout and stderr for
    each command to a log file:

    system("sa &gt;&amp /tmp/log");

[5] Make sure the complexity of the
    SAOL code in sl and the note 
    density of the score in ss 
    matches the speed of the CPU.

<H2><A NAME="code">Adding Features to Sfront</A></H2>

<P>
The score transcription application described in the last section
specifies the notes to be played in a static manner. It writes a SASL
file, and then invokes sfront to create a sound engine that plays the
file.  The application also statically specifies the audio routing, by
invoking sfront with the <TT>-aout linux</TT> option.

<P>
However, some end-user applications are a bad match for a static
audio and control approach. Examples of such applications include:

<OL>
<LI>
An Internet audio streaming application, that streams SASL or MIDI
control events over an IP network and feed them into a running SAOL
program.
<LI>
Interactive music production systems, where knobs and sliders need
to be interactively linked to SAOL program variables, external 
input from a MIDI keyboard needs to be dynamically routed to different
SAOL elements, and audio input and output streams need to be patched
into the SAOL <TT>input_bus</TT> and <TT>output_bus</TT>.
</OL>

<P>
For sfront to support these programs,
application-specific code must be added to the <TT>sa.c</TT> file
that sfront produces. A host program would still use <TT>system</TT>
commands to prepare and launch the <TT>sa.c</TT> program, but the
application-specific code in the <TT>sa.c</TT> program could handle
the dynamic functions, perhaps by communicating to the host program
using inter-process communication.

<P> 
The sfront driver interface lets application developers add C or C++
code into the <TT>sa.c</TT> file in a standardized way. In addition to
supporting application-specific uses for sfront, the driver interface
is the mechanism for adding general-purpose sfront features that
involve control and audio communication.

<P>
In the final section of this chapter, we introduce the concept of
audio and control drivers.  The next two chapters describe the process
of writing control and audio drivers in depth.

<H2><A NAME="driver">The Driver Interface</A></H2>

<P>
The driver interface lets users specify, on the the sfront
command line, the inclusion of C or C++ code into the generated C
file. Two types of drivers are currently supported: 

<OL>
<LI>
<B>Control drivers</B>. Control drivers can insert SASL and MIDI
commands into a running Structured Audio engine during each k cycle.
The semantics of the control driver interface supports the simple
creation of MPEG-4 compliant streaming decoders. The control driver
API also includes data structures to inform the control driver about
the SAOL program structure, as well as functions for reading variables
and altering time. These supplementary calls support applications
beyond streaming decoders, such as symbolic debugging, patch editors,
and interactive sequencer programs.
<LI>
<B>Audio drivers</B>. Audio drivers can insert audio streams into
running SAOL engines, via the SAOL <TT>input_bus</TT>, and can pipe
audio streams out of the SAOL engine, via the SAOL <TT>output_bus</TT>.
The audio driver API supports real-time, low-latency audio I/O, and
can also be used for file I/O purposes.
</OL>

<P>
To create a new driver, two tasks are involved. The larger task is to
create the C or C++ code that is included into the <TT>sa.c</TT>
file. This code includes a set of functions, described in the API,
that are called by sfront at regular intervals. The control
driver calls allow the driver to insert control data into the running
program, while the audio driver calls let the driver pick up or
deliver audio streaming data. During each function call, the driver
can communicate with other processes running on the system, as well as
read and write external hardware devices such as MIDI In ports.

<P>
In addition to creating the included C or C++ code, a new driver needs
to be registered with sfront, so that <TT>-cin</TT>,
<TT>-ain</TT>, and <TT>-aout</TT> flags recognize the driver. This
registration task involves appending information to parsing functions
in the sfront source files.


<H4>Current Limitations</H4>

<P>
At the current time, the audio and control driver APIs do not
support adding new plug-in formats to <TT>sfront</TT>.  The
AudioUnit drivers work using private additions to the driver APIs.
We intend to generalize these additions so that they will support
other plug-in formats, and add them to the official control and
audio driver APIs.

<P>
At the current time, only one control driver (specified by the 
<TT>-cin</TT> flag on the sfront command line) and two audio
control drivers (an audio input driver, specified by the 
<TT>-ain</TT> flag, and an audio output driver, specified by the
<TT>-aout</TT> flag) may be specified. However, the APIs have
been designed to support future expansion to support multiple
audio and control drivers, and we believe that adding this feature 
would not break backward compatibility for properly written drivers.

<P>
At the current time, the registration process requires recompilation
of the sfront sources. Future enhancements will support adding new
drivers to sfront without recompilation.
