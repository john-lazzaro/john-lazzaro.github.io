<H2><A NAME="platform">Supported Platforms</A></H2>

<P>
Sfront is written in ANSI C and uses only ANSI C libraries.  When
executed, sfront creates ANSI C files that only use ANSI C
libraries.  

<P>
These attributes make sfront portable over a wide number of platforms,
with ancillary files (makefiles, project files, etc.) and real-time
support being the primary portability issues.

<P>
The right panel shows the platforms sfront is currently known to work.
A checkbox in the <I>R</I> column indicates basic file rendering
functionality. 

<P>
The <I>S</I>, <I>M</I>, and <I>P</I> columns indicate support for
audio output and input to soundcards, MIDI control input from an
external controller, and plug-in support.

<P>
We currently provide a generic source distribution, suitable for use
on most UNIX variants (including Linux and Mac OS X) as well as
Microsoft Windows.  <!--The Debian project <A
HREF="http://packages.debian.org/testing/sound/sfront.html">offers</A>
a binary distribution of sfront, which is maintained by Enrique
Robledo Arnuncio.-->

<P>
We develop sfront under Mac OS X; the sfront user community is
instrumental in porting and testing to other platforms.

<P>
Thanks to Ross Bencina, Richard Dobson, Michael Gogins, Peter Maas,
Kees van Prooijen, and Tim Thompson for Microsoft support. Thanks to
Bertrand Petit for FreeBSD support. Thanks to the coreaudio-api and
darwin list members, and Manfred Brockhaus, BUYO-BUYO-IGOR, Phil Burk,
Richard Dobson, Dominic Mazzoni, and Juno for Mac OS support. Thanks
to Michael Pruett for IRIX support.  Thanks to Jeremy Voorhis and
Christian Haines for testing AudioUnit plug-in support.

<H2>Compiler Support</H2>
<TT>
<pre>
Sfront, and the C code sfront
generates, compiles under gcc
on all platforms.

Under Windows, compiles using 
Microsoft Visual C++ compiler 
and Borland C++.

Under Mac OS X, compiles with 
cc/gcc. 

Under Mac OS 9, sfront compiles,
but the C code sfront creates is
not completely stable (the sample
wavetable generator and MIDI 
file input are the major issues).

Sfront is free software, distributed under the terms of the BSD

<H4>Unpacking <TT>wxyz.tar.gz</TT> files</H4>

<P>
The source distributions intended for Mac OS X, Linux, and generic UNIX
systems are in the form of a UNIX tar file, compressed with the gzip
utility (i.e. <TT>wxyz.tar.gz</TT>, or perhaps <TT>wxyz.tar</TT> if
your browser automatically uncompresses files). The commands:

<TT>
<pre>
gunzip sfront.tar.gz
tar -xf sfront.tar
</pre>
</TT>

<P>
should unpack this file and create
the directory sfront. If the 
download generates the file
sfront.tar, only execute the
second command.

<H4>Unpacking <TT>wxyz.zip</TT> files</H4>

<P>
The distributions intended for Windows systems are in the form of a

To compile sfront under UNIX, begin by

directory. Edit the <TT>Makefile</TT> in
this directory, making the changes suggested
on the right panel.

<P>
Once these changes are made, simply type

If all goes well, this command will trigger the compilation of all the

<H2>Makefile options</H2>

<TT>
<pre>
Before starting compilation, 
edit the Makefile and read 
the comments for suggestions
on how to customize sfront for
your environment. In particular:


BINDIR = ../bin/

BINDIR is where the binary of
sfront is copied. BINDIR defaults
to the sfront/bin directory, but
you may wish to put the binary
somewhere else. The complete path
for BINDIR must be in your shell 
path in order to use sfront on
the command line.


CC = gcc 

CC specifies the the C compiler.
On early versions of Mac OS X, the 
Developer Tools installs gcc as cc, 
and so  "gcc" must be changed to "cc".


LINKLIB = -lm

In some systems, LINKLIB will need
extra options -- if you find that
compilation works but linking fails,
change this line.

<P>
We recommend Mac OS X for Macintosh users; sfront compiles and has
been well tested on 10.7 (Lion) and 10.4 (Tiger).  We do not have
access to 10.5/10.6 machines, and so compatability reports would be
appreciated.  For stand-alone programs, sfront supports low-latency
audio I/O under OS X using the CoreAudio framework.  Sfront also
supports the AudioUnit plug-in format.

<P>
Sfront also compiles on Mac OS 9, using the the free <A
HREF="http://developer.apple.com/tools/mpw-tools/">MPW</A> system to
compile sfront and the C files it creates. Build sfront as an MPW tool
and add it to your path, so that it can be used as a command-line tool
in the MPW shell. Also build sa.c files as MPW-tools.

<P>
MIDI file and sample file reading is unstable under MPW, and so
several of the examples shipped with sfront will not work under OS 9.

<H2><A NAME="test">Testing sfront</A></H2>

<P>
The sfront distribution includes a set of example files, to test
different aspects of the program. The example files are located in
subdirectories that are in <TT>sfront/examples</TT>. If you installed
a packaged version of sfront, copy <TT>/usr/doc/sfront/examples</TT>
to your home directory). Not all sfront distributions contain the same
examples, due to file size and legal issues.

<P>
Each of the example directories share a common structure.  The
directories include a <TT>Makefile</TT>, a SAOL file, and any other
files needed in the example. See the right panel for a description of
the examples.

<P>
Entering any of these directories and typing <TT>make</TT> results in
the generation of an <TT>output.wav</TT> audio performance (an
exception is the example <TT>in</TT>, which cannot be made until
example <TT>beat</TT> is made). Mac OS X users may need to change the
CC in each Makefile, from "gcc" to "cc".

<P>
The simplest example is <TT>examples/min</TT>, which should exist in
all sfront distributions. Enter this
directory, type <TT>make</TT>, and the command should finish a few
seconds later, after running

<UL>
<LI>
<TT>sfront</TT>, which produces the file <TT>sa.c</TT>.

   produced.

-- If the C file sfront produced
   didn't compile, the compiler
   error messages.

-- If the file produced by sfront
   crashed while running, any ASCII
   messages printed by sfront or the
   OS.

-- Information on the platform 
   you're running on, including
   type of OS (including version
   number) and type of compiler 
   (including version number).

-- The version number of sfront.

-- A short note explaining the problem,
   including what you heard.

-- DON'T send any binary files (.mp4,
   output.wav, ect) at first -- I'll
   let you know if I need them later.
