<TT>
<pre>
Version 0.99 -- 8/31/11  (<A HREF="../install/index.html#download">download</A>)

[1] Sfront is now compatible with
Mac OS X Lion, including the AudioUnit,
CoreAudio, and CoreMIDI drivers.


Version 0.98 -- 7/21/10

[1] Audio output of AudioUnits
generated by sfront no longer
clips sample values to [-1.0, 1.0].


Version 0.97 -- 3/8/10

[1] Improved user-interface support 
for AudioUnits generated by sfront. 
Writes by SAOL code to AudioUnit
parameter variables are reflected
in the user interface, and naming
conventions for parameter variables
support display-only user interface
widgets (such as grayed-out checkboxes).
See this <A HREF="../../../book/special/au/index.html#parameters">section</A> of the MP4-SA 
book for details.

[2] Improved Leopard support for
Audiounits. Improved support for
Debian standards.


Version 0.96 -- 1/12/10  (<A HREF="../install/index.html#download">download</A>)

[1] Improved user-interface support 
for AudioUnits generated by sfront. 
Sliders have programmable tapering 
(from log to exp), a slider's unit 
label may now be specified, and 
support for menus and checkboxes
has been improved. In addition, irrelevant 
properties no longer clutter the UI.
See this <A HREF="../../../book/special/au/index.html#parameters">section</A> of the MP4-SA 
book for details.


Version 0.95 -- 12/28/09

[1] Effect AudioUnits generated
by sfront are now compatible with
Ableton Live (tested on Live 8 
on Mac OS X Tiger/PPC).

Version 0.94 -- 12/14/09

[1] AudioUnits generated by
sfront can now use a custom
Cocoa view.  The release 
includes an example AU that
is a SAOL rewrite of Apple's
FilterDemo AU.  The example 
uses a modified version of 
Apple's FilterDemo Cocoa UI 
view (written in Objective-C).
See this <A HREF="../../../book/special/au/index.html#lpf">section</A> of the MP4-SA 
book for details.

Version 0.93 -- 11/2/09

[1] Sfront now creates sa.c
files that will produce 
correct results using the
64-bit memory model of gcc
(gcc -m64) on x86 CPUs.

Version 0.92 -- 9/16/09

[1] Sfront now supports the
creation of AudioUnit plug-ins,
under Tiger and Leopard (but
not yet Snow Leopard). See 
this <A HREF="../../../book/special/au/index.html">chapter</A> of the MP4-SA 
book for details.

Version 0.91 -- 7/30/06

[1] Bug fix: sfront now defaults
to writing 16-bit WAV and AIFF 
files, and the command-line flags
for specifying 16-bit WAV and AIFF
files now work correctly (thanks
to Francois Pinot).

[2] Bug fixes in the documentation
and implementation of the custom
control driver API (thanks to 
Francois Pinot).

Version 0.90 -- 7/03/06

[1] Sfront has been relicensed to
use the BSD license (without the
advertising clause).

[2] If the SAOL global parameter
interp is set to 1, sfront uses
band-limited windowed sinc function
interpolation for most normative
interpolations defined in the MPEG
standard (opcodes such as doscil, 
oscil, tableread, fracdelay, etc).
An exception is the grain() core
opcode, which still uses linear
interpolation when interp=1. As
a convenience, sfront has new
command-line options to adjust
the interpolation algorithm 
(<A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#interp">-interp</A>, <A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#sinc_zcross">-sinc_zcross</A>, and 
<A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#sinc_pilen">-sinc_pilen</A>).

[3] 64-bit integer arithmetic is
now used in the implementation of
phase pointers for most core opcodes
(the grain() opcode is an exception,
grain uses float phase pointers). This
change fixes the phase slipping problems
reported by Florian Walter.

[4] 8-bit and 24-bit WAV and AIFF
files are now supported by the 
sample wavetable generator, and
by the -ain fname.{wav,aif} and
-aout fname.{wav,aif} drivers.
See <A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#aout">-aout</A> for output syntax.

[5] It is now possible to specify
the input channel of a stereo 
WAV or AIFF file used by the
sample wavetable generator, 
using the "filname.wav@n",
when n = 0 or 1.  This supports
the creation of SAOL sample 
playback engines that access 
a database of stereo samples.

[6] The network musical performance
library has been updated to reflect
the final RTP MIDI payload format
that will appear in IESG-approved
Internet-Drafts, that should appear
as IETF RFCs later this year.

[7] A few bug fixes.  (a) The fir, iir,
and reverb core opcodes may now
be used as oparrays, fixing a bug
reported by Jonathan Beyer. (b) 
Constant tables defined in the 
startup instrument no longer cause
a run-time crash.  (c) Table
imports in the startup instrument
that would produce a run-time
error now generate a warning
message, fixing a bug reported
by Robert of all-your-bass.



Version 0.89 -- 6/18/05 

[1] Source code changes to eliminate
new warning messages from gcc 4.0.0.

[2] Changes to sfront networking code
to match the latest RTP MIDI changes
(draft-ietf-avt-rtp-midi-format-09.txt).


Version 0.88 -- 12/26/04 

[1] Networking updated to match
draft-ietf-avt-rtp-midi-format-07.

   Chapter M fields for A-BUTTON
   and C-BUTTON use new G bit layout 
   and compute count for large values 
   correctly. 

   Sender supports the oldest-first
   log ordering for Chapters E/A/N.

   Sender supports new Chapter Q 
   coding rule Start and Continue
   commands. 

   SDP sent in SIP INVITEs uses 
   rtp_maxptime and rtp_ptime, and
   uses correct SDP syntax.

[2] The -sip_ip parameter now parses
dotted-quads correctly.

[2] Memory management bugs fixed
(thanks to Graydon Hoare).

[3] Correct value for PI used in
code examples, book (thanks to 
<A HREF="http://tiaan.com/">Tiaan Geldenhuys</A>).


Version 0.87 -- 10/15/04

[1] Networking knows the
new IP number of the 
Berkeley SIP server.

[2] Compilation times of
Mac OS X are improved.


Version 0.86 -- 4/24/04 

[1] Networking now conforms
to the RTP payload format for
MIDI under development in the
Audio/Video Transport group
of the Internet Engineering
Task Force.  

[2] The download page no longer
offers RedHat or Debian packages,
because I no longer have root access
to a desktop Linux workstation to
build and test packages.  However,
the official Debian package for
sfront 0.85 still exists, and will 
hopefully be updated to 0.86.

[3] Several minor bugfixes.


Version 0.85 -- 9/13/02

[1] Mac OS X support for
real-time MIDI control, 
using the <TT><A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#coremidi">-cin coremidi</A></TT>
control driver. Up to four
external MIDI sources are
recognized. Virtual sources
are ignored; expect virtual
source support in a future 
release.

[2] Mac OS X memory locking
now works in normal user 
processes, and is no longer 
limited to root.


<TT>
<pre>
Version 0.84 -- 8/29/02 

[1] CoreAudio I/O now
works correctly under
Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar).
Thanks to Juno.

[2] Large -latency values
no longer hang CoreAudio;
documentation for -latency
option is now accurate for
CoreAudio. Thanks to Manfred
Brockhaus.

[3] Sfront networking now
works under Mac OS X, 
including PPP and DHCP.

Version 0.83 -- 8/11/02 

[1] Low-latency audio
<A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#coreaudio_out">output</A> and <A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#coreaudio_in">input</A> now
supported for Mac OS X
using CoreAudio. 
Developed on a TiBook
under 10.1.5; please
send reports for other
platforms. Thanks to
coreaudio-api and
darwin mailing list
members for extensive
API help.

[2] Compile-time
warnings under 
Visual C++ fixed.
Thanks to Kees van
Prooijen.

Version 0.82 -- 7/23/02

[1] Bugfixes for large
spline and cubicseg
wavetables, and for 
polymorphic opcodes
used in wavetables.
Thanks to Michael B.

[2] SIP server IP 
numbers updated for
sfront networking. To
use earlier sfront 
versions with the
new SIP server, add

-sip_ip 128.32.112.203

to the sfront command
line.


Version 0.81 -- 5/24/02 

[1] Bugfixes for sfront
code generation and for
the SLib library. Thanks
to Manfred Brockhaus and
Michael McGonagle.

Version 0.80 -- 5/08/02 

[1] Sfront complies with
the MPEG 4 Structured 
Audio COR2 Corrigenda
(March 2002). See this
<A HREF="../../../book/append/cor2/index.html">guide</A> to COR2 changes
for more details.

[2] The MP4-SA book is
now licensed under
the GNU Free Documentation
License, and is bundled
with all versions of the
sfront distribution.

[3] Many bugfixes. 


Version 0.79 -- 11/04/01 

[1] Performance tuning for
audio streaming under Mac
OS X. Thanks to Richard 
Dobson and Robert.


Version 0.78 -- 10/23/01 

[1] Sfront buffer overflow
bugfix, caused fatal errors
under Mac OS X. Thanks to
Robert.

Version 0.77 -- 10/12/01 

[1] New <TT><A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#mac_carbon">mac_carbon</A></TT>
audio driver for Mac OS X,
using the Carbon framework.
Bugfixes for Windows WMME
and DirectSound drivers. 
Thanks to <A HREF="http://www.portaudio.com">portaudio.com</A>,
Phil Burk, Richard Dobson,
and Dominic Mazzoni.


Version 0.76 -- 9/23/01

[1] Enhanced audio
driver <A HREF="../../devel/adriver/index.html">API</A> to support
soundcard APIs that 
require callback functions. 

[2] New <TT><A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#pa_win_wmme">ps_win_wmme</A></TT>
and <TT><A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#pa_win_ds">ps_win_ds</A></TT> audio

Thanks to the <A HREF="http://www.portaudio.com">PortAudio</A>
team, and testers Richard
Dobson, Peter Maas, Kees van
Prooijen, and Tim Thompson.

[3] Audio drivers now control 
default <A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#timemanage">time option</A> selection.

[4] Many bugfixes in
SAOL audio bus system.
Thanks to Robert Sherry.


Version 0.75 -- 8/13/01 

[0] Sfront networking
now works well with DHCP,
otherwise unchanged from
sfront 0.74. Thanks to
Mike McGonagle.


Version 0.74 -- 8/04/01  

[1] First release for 
sfront <A HREF="../network/index.html">networking</A>.

[2] Audio <A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#irix">driver</A> for Irix
(6.2 and above). Thanks 
to Michael Pruett (SGI).

[3] The sfront manual is
now under the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html">GFDL</A>, for
Debian compatibility. 
Thanks to Enrique Arnuncio
for help with the Debian
issues. Note the MP4-SA
book license is unchanged.

[4] New SAOL resonant
physical model library.
See examples/bach and
several examples/linux
files for SAOL produced
by the library, and see
sfront/lib/reson/README
for library details.

[5] Many bug fixes,
thanks to Robert Sherry,
Michael McGonagle, and
Kees van Prooijen.

Version 0.72 -- 7/10/01 

[1] The -cin ascii control
driver has been rewritten:
it maps the ASCII keyboard
as a two-octave pentatonic
scale, with fixed note length.
Special keys control MIDI 
presets and channel volume.
Tested under Linux, should 
work on any OS that supports
the termios API.

[2] Sfront now fully tested
under Mac OS X version 10.0.3.
Work on Mac OS 9.1 under MPW
has yet to resolve problems 
related to sample file and
MIDI file reading, and so OS 
X is the most viable option for
sfront Mac OS users. Thanks to
Manfred Brockhaus.

[3] Numerous bug fixes: variable
length core opcodes work in
oparrays, the && and || operators
work for vectors, unused exports 
signal variables work correctly, 
several audio-bus errors fixed, SASL
labelled control statements access
multiple instrs correctly, large 
constant integer values correctly 
supported. Thanks to Robert Sherry
and Axel Nackaerts.


Version 0.71 -- 3/29/01 

[1] Bugfixes for user-defined 
opcodes that use slower-rate 
statements. Thanks to Robert
Sherry and Robin Davies. 


Version 0.70 -- 2/20/01 

[0] Added MPW-related 
bugfix -- otherwise
identical to 0.69, whose
change-log items are 
listed below.

[1] Sfront is compliant
with the COR1 document,
a new MPEG Corrigenda that
updates the SAOL language.
See this <A HREF="http://john-lazzaro.github.io/sa/book/append/cor1/index.html">appendix</A> of the
MP4-SA Book to learn about 
the SAOL changes in COR1.

[2] New <A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#cin">alsaseq</A> control driver
written by Enrique Robledo
Arnuncio, for MIDI control
using the Linux ALSA sequencer.

[3] Many bug fixes, including
compliant global parameter 
krate determination when
srate/krate is non-integral
(thanks to Ross Bencina), 
Macintosh MPW compilation
fixes (thanks to BUYO-BUYO-
IGOR). 


Version 0.68 -- 10/28/00 

[1] C code generated for
MIDI control now compiles
faster.

[2] Many contributed bug
fixes, thanks to Kees van
Prooijen, Richard Dobson,
the saol.net folks, and M. 
Edward Borasky.


Version 0.67 -- 09/09/00 

[0] Another bugfix for
Windows sfront.dsp file
(thanks to Kees van Prooijen).
Rest of items unchanged
since 0.65.

[1] C code generated for
SAOL and SASL wavetables
compiles much quicker and
runs with improved cache
behavior. C code created
for the "sample" wavetable
generator no longer includes
an WAV or AIFF parser,
and moderately-sized constant
tables for all generators are
computed by sfront and placed
into the sa.c file as constant
float arrays. On some machine/
compiler configurations,
the sfront <A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#hexdata">-hexdata</A> flag
offers additional compilation
speedup, by encoding arrays
as hexadecimal strings.

[2] C code generated for 
wide oparrays compiles much
quicker and runs with improved
cache behavior (thanks to 
Richard Dobson). 

[3] Many sa.c memory leaks
involving wavetables have
been fixed, reducing the
working memory space of 
table-intensive programs.

[4] Bugfixes involving the
dur standard name (thanks to
Tobiah), empty opcode 
return() statements (thanks
to Ross Bencina), name
space collisions (thanks to
Aaron Finch), oparrays, and
wavetables.


Version 0.64 -- 08/02/00 

[1] Optimizations for 
accessing global variables
(via import/export) and 
opcode parameters, to 
eliminate unneeded copying.
Programs that use these
language features extensively
should see significant 
speedups (thanks to Dave
Gillepsie).

[2] Linux rpm and deb binary
packages now available for
download (thanks to Enrique
Arnuncio and Joey Hess).

[3] Bugfixes for fft/ifft
shift-and-add mode (a 
startup artifact was 
eliminated, and an boxcar
windowed fft/ifft pair 
has unity gain, thanks to
Richard Dobson).

[4] Bug fixes for ANSI 
constant compatibility
(thanks for Aaron Finch)
and name-space clashes,
and a null -ain/-aout
driver added was (thanks
to Mike McGonagle).



Version 0.63 -- 07/10/00 

[0] Several cross-platform
bugfixes (Thanks to Michael
McGonagle and Richard Dobson).
Rest of change log from 0.62.

[1] Standard name <A HREF="http://john-lazzaro.github.io/sa/book/control/saolc/index.html#stnames">cpuload</A>
is now supported in -playback
and -timesync mode, for
all drivers. Cpuload is a
ksig, that takes on a value
between 0 (machine is not
loaded at all) and 1 (any
further loading of machine
risks loss of real-time 
playback). Cpuload is 
computed with no temporal
filtering or windowing, 
and shows the performance
on the last kcycle.

[2] The -ain/-aout linux
and -cin linmidi drivers 
are <A HREF="../rtime/index.html#interact">enhanced</A>. The drivers
are more robust against 
lockup and MIDI data loss.
When run as root, the driver
uses POSIX real-time scheduling
to reduce audio dropouts
(while we have carefully
tested these root features,
bugs in programs run as root
can cause file-system damage:
use at your own risk). Sa.c
start-up screen now suggests
the best sfront flags to use
for a given patch. FreeBSD and
linux sources are now merged,
with many of these features
available for both operating
systems. Thanks to Paul 
Barton-Davis, Bertrand Petit,
Benno Senoner, Kai Vehmanen,
and the folks at <A HREF="http://www.saol.net">saol.net</A>.

[3] Bugfixes in: memory
allocation, dsound driver,
random number generators,
polymorphic table opcode
rate semantics, -cin fstr
file streaming, wavetable
generator sizing, and 
array parameters in user
defined opcodes. Thanks
to Richard Dobson and
the folks at <A HREF="http://www.saol.net">saol.net</A>.



Version 0.61 -- 05/28/00 

[1] Sfront is now includes
Slib, a SAOL library that
provides support utilities
to simplify low-level SAOL 
programming. See this new
<A HREF="http://john-lazzaro.github.io/sa/book/special/slib/index.html">chapter</A> of the MP4-SA 
book for details.

[2] New linux/linbuzz 
example, that shows the
MIDI features of Slib
in a real-time instrument.

[3] New optimization: faster
execution of expressions like
tableread(t, int(x)), by 
eliminating interpolation code.

[4] Bugfixes for the dynamic
instr command, the outbus command,
the buzz opcode and wavetable
generator, specialop expressions, 
opcode table initializations that
use opcode parameters, send
statements that target the
output_bus, and user-defined
opcode rate warnings.

Version 0.60 -- 05/07/00 

[0] Minor buzz() opcode 
bugfix -- rest of change
log describes changes
between 0.58 and 0.59.

[1] Rate-semantic <A HREF="http://john-lazzaro.github.io/sa/book/special/debug/index.html#printf">printf</A>
statement implemented,
and a new <A HREF="http://john-lazzaro.github.io/sa/book/special/debug/index.html">book chapter</A> 
on debugging SAOL 
shows how to use it.
Like all sfront SAOL
extensions, sfront 
drops printf statements
as it encodes MP4 files,
and printf is not a reserved
word if the <A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#isoflags">-isosyntax</A>
flag is set. New <A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#isoflags">-isocheck</A>
flag also helps debugging,
adding many run-time checks.

[2] "C pre-processing" of 
SAOL and SASL is now 
<A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#preprocess">integrated</A> into sfront,
with line-number support 
for error messages, a
post-processor that strips
stray semicolons. To support
library development, sfront
now supports multiple <A HREF="http://john-lazzaro.github.io/sa/book/saol/vars/index.html#vars_global">global</A>
blocks in a program. Thanks
to Michael McGonagle.

[3] MIDI controller, 
aftertouch, and pitch
bend information is now
visible to effects and
SASL instruments. See
this <A HREF="http://john-lazzaro.github.io/sa/book/control/midi/index.html#stnames">book section</A>
for details. Thanks to
Robin Davies and <A HREF="http://www.saol.net">saol.net</A>.

[4] Support added to 
<A HREF="../use/index.html#input">querying</A> audio input
sources for sample rate
and channel width of
<B>input_bus</B>, if not
specified in global block.

[5] Control drivers can
now control <A HREF="../../devel/cdriver/data/index.html#bifs">BIFS</A> variables
(including params[]) as
accessed by SAOL code. 

[6] Bug fixes: expressions
used in array/opcode/table
indexing now executed just
once (formerly done twice
due to buggy rounding code),
buzz opcode now works for
large rolloff and nharm
values, user-defined opcode
calls in the global block
now work correctly, recursive
opcode calls generate an
error message, Kaiser window
table generator bugs fixed.
Many bugs in MIDI File
support fixed (thanks to
<A HREF="http://www.saol.net">saol.net</A>.)



Version 0.58 -- 04/17/00 

[1] The control driver
API has been improved.
It can now support 
compliant execution of
MP4 SA_access_units,
as well as patch editor,
CLI, and symbolic debug
applications. It 
includes many data 
structures that let
the control driver 
discover information
about the SAOL and SASL
files used to generate
the sa.c it lives in.

[2] The <A HREF="../../index.html">programmers</A> <A HREF="../../index.html">
manual</A> for sfront has
been reworked, and now
includes an <A HREF="../../devel/intro/index.html">introductory</A>
section that explains
how to use sfront from
other programs, and a
<A HREF="../../devel/cdriver/intro/index.html">multi-part manual</A>
on the control driver
interface.

[3] A <A HREF="../rtime/index.html#fstr">file streaming</A>
control driver has 
been written to 
demonstrate the new
API. It opens an MP4
file during the start
of sa.c execution, 
seeks past the config
section, and then 
dynamically executes
SA_access_unit stream
packets. It contains
much of the codebase
needed for true
MP4-SA network streamer.

[4] The spline wavetable
generator was described
incorrectly in the MP4-SA
book, and implemented 
incorrectly in sfront.
Both book and program
are now fixed. See this
<A HREF="http://john-lazzaro.github.io/sa/book/saol/wave/index.html#env">book section</A> for the
correct syntax (page down
to the spline generator).

[5] SAOL random opcodes
now produce a different
random number stream on
each <TT>sa.c</TT> run. New
<A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#fixedseed"><TT>-fixedseed</TT></A> sfront option
simplifies SAOL program
testing, by making all
random opcodes produce a
deterministic number stream
on every <TT>sa.c</TT> run.
Thanks to Martin Marier and
Michael McGonagle.

[6] Many bugs were 
fixed. Most bugs were
in SASL and SAOL wave
table generator code,
and in the control
driver code. Bugs were
also fixed in the 
linmidi driver.


Version 0.57 -- 03/8/00 


[0] Windows distribution
issues, and several bugs,
that were found in 0.56
are fixed -- thanks to
Daniel Kahlin, Michael
McGonagle, Kees van
Prooijen, and Richard
Dobson. Remaining change
log entries are carried
over from 0.56.

[1] The -bit option now
reads SA files that have
streaming data (i.e.
SA_access_units). All
event_types are supported
(SASL score_lines, MIDI 
midi_events, and the sample
type for table data). SASL
score_lines that use both
relative and absolute
timestamps can be read
(i.e. has_time = 0 and 1).

[2] The -bitout option now
writes binary files that
include SA_access_units. 
The new 

-sstrout filename.sasl 
-mstrout filename.mid

options specify the SASL and
MIDI files for encoding as
SA_access_units. Files 
specified using the older
options:

-sco filename.sasl 
-midi filename.mid

are encoded as part of the
preamble of the binary file
(StructuredAudioSpecificConfig)
as before. If SASL table
commands are used with the
sample wavetable generator,
the WAV or AIFF file specified
becomes a streaming sample
chunk.

[3] Bug fixes: skip and size
fields work correctly in 
sample wavetable generator
(thanks to Bertrand Petit),
bugs in dynamic instrs fixed
(thanks to Michael McGonagle),
bugs in the AIFF audio input
driver fixed.

[4] Default help printout
shortened (-help prints out
the longer option listing).




Version 0.55 -- 02/12/00 

[1] Base frequency and loop
points can be read by the
sample wavetable generator,
for both AIFF and WAV files,
and this looping information
is correctly captured in .mp4
files (Thanks to Kees van
Prooijen).

[2] SAOL template improvements:
the restrictions on the use
of "&lt" and "&gt" in maplist
expressions have been removed,
many bugs have been fixed, and
a new <A HREF="http://john-lazzaro.github.io/sa/book/template/">template chapter</A>
in the MP4-SA book is now online.

[3] Control and audio drivers
can now access command-line
options of the program containing
them, and policy has been set to
share the command-line-option
namespace. See the
audio driver <A HREF="../../devel/adriver/">documentation</A>
and Part III of the control
driver <A HREF="../../devel/cdriver/intro/">documentation</A>
for details. Thanks to Michael 
McGonagle.

[4] Linux/FreeBSD driver
enhancements: more soundcards
are permitted to use -timesync
mode, and warning messages are
printed for ill-advised use of
timing flags.

[5] Bug fixes: MIDIctrl standard
name now works as an lval, control
driver interface bugs fixed (thanks
to the SAOL Projekt).



Version 0.54 -- 01/27/00 

[1] The sample wavetable 
generator can now read
base frequency and loop
start and end points from
the smpl chunk of Microsoft
WAV files (Thanks to Kees 
van Prooijen). MP4 file encoding
and decoding correctly packs
and unpacks this data into
the binary MP4 encoding.
Bugs handling 8-bit AIFF
and WAV file data in MP4
encoding and decoding and
in sample wavetable generator
fixed.

[2] Concat wavetable generator
bugs fixed.

[3] Several SAOL and SASL file
parsing errors fixed (thanks
to Bertrand Petit and to the
members of the SAOL Projekt).

[4] Non-ANSI strdup() calls
removed from sfront and 
generated code.


Version 0.53 -- 01/12/00 

[1] Several new optimizations: 

   [a] Instr and opcode tables
       generators with constant
       parameters are converted
       to imports tables.

   [b] Instr code in while and
       if-else blocks are now
       rate-optimized (i.e. 
       slower subexpressions 
       are moved to i-rate or
       k-rate if it is safe to
       do so).

[2] <A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#freebsdaout">Audio drivers</A> for FreeBSD  
(thanks to Bertrand Petit).

[3] New <A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#except">-except</A> sfront option,
includes a signal handler for 
gracefully shutting down audio
drivers if generated C program
terminates abnormally. Compiles
as vanilla ANSI C, but may not
work well on non-POSIX systems
(thanks to Bertrand Petit).

[4] Divide-by-zero bugs 
fixed in the aline, kline,
aexpon, and kexpon core 
opcodes (thanks to Bertrand
Petit). Bugs fixed in table
and tablemap accesses in 
deeply nested oparrays. Bugs
fixed in template expression
substitution.

[5] New binary distributions
for Linux and DOS/Windows.
The DOS/Windows releases
are built using the
dos-gcc cross-compiler that
runs under Linux. 



Version 0.52 -- 01/03/00 

[1] Extensive optimizations
and bug fixes for the 
filter, spectral analysis,
gain control, sample 
conversion, delay, and
effects core opcodes, the
pluck and grain signal
generator core opcodes,
and the spatialize statement.


[2] All a-rate core opcodes
now function correctly when
enclosed in if and while 
statements with a-rate guards
(thanks to Ross Bencina).


[3] Runtimef.c file now 
included in lib/csrc/
directory -- thanks to 
Bertrand Petit.



Version 0.50 -- 12/17/99 

[1] The code sfront 
generates for wavetable
data structures has been
improved, and many core
opcodes and language 
elements run faster as
a result.


[2] Many bug fixes: nested
oparrays of user-defined
opcodes now work correctly,
a specialop bug that broke
the linux/linvoc example is
fixed, and complex wavetable
generates now work correctly.
Thanks to Dan Ellis and 
Reynald Hoskinson.



Version 0.49 -- 12/04/99 

[1] Optimizations of 
several core opcodes:
buzz, aline, kline,
aexpon, and kexpon.


[2] Imports tables are
now implemented as
imports exports tables 
when it is safe to do so.


Version 0.48 -- 11/22/99 

[1] Fixes optimizer bugs, and
adds new optimizations. New 
optimizations focus on effects
instruments, and specializes
generated code to the unique
properties of instruments
launched using send().

[2] Duration and delay 
arguments to SAOL instr
command now correctly 
interpreted as having units
of beats.


Version 0.46 -- 11/16/99 

[1] Fixes optimizer bugs, and
adds new optimizations. New 
optimizations stem from a 
reference-counting scheme that
tracks variables in SAOL code.

[2] Win32 DirectSound output
driver is now works better,
and has been tested on SB
Live, SB16, and Creamware
Pulsar cards. Requires 7.0
version of DirectSound, and
may have problems working 
under NT/Windows 2000. Thanks 
to Vincent Siliakus and Thomas
Jongepier.

[3] New control input driver
<A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#cin">alsamidi</A> supports real-time 
MIDI input under Linux using
the ALSA sound system (note
OSS audio input and output
drivers already work with ALSA).
Thanks to Steven Pickles.


Version 0.44 -- 11/01/99 

[1] Fixes optimizer bugs, and
adds minor optimizations. Major
parts of the compiler have been
rewritten to support future 
optimization releases.



Version 0.43 -- 09/28/99 

[1] Fixes code optimization bugs
(0.42 produces incorrect code for 
certain arithmetic expressions).
Running 0.42 with -O0 option 
should avoid these bugs, but
will also avoid all optimization!


Version 0.42 -- 09/19/99 

[1] Rate optimization added
to sfront -- slower-rate
subexpressions are factored
out and executed in a slower
pass. Default is complete 
optimization, new <A HREF="../cmdline/index.html#optoptions">flags</A>
control turning off parts of
the optimizer.

[2] Fixed dsound code generation
bugs (but not underlying sound
generation bugs). Thanks to
Michael Gogins.



Version 0.41 -- 09/10/99 

[1] Fixed bugs affecting the
special "startup" instrument
(thanks to Michel Jullian).

Version 0.40 -- 09/05/99 

[1] Sfront can now handle audio
input and output drivers that 
require floating-point data
buffers. See <A HREF="../../devel/adriver/index.html">audio driver</A>
documentation for details.

[2] New -ain and -aout options
for .dat files, the ASCII data
format for the curve graphing
program view (part of the
<A HREF="http://john-lazzaro.github.io/chipmunk/describe/describe.html">Chipmunk</A> tools, a UNIX toolset
under the GPL). This option uses
a floating-point driver.

Version 0.39 -- 09/03/99 

[1] Core opcodes now handle 
negative frequency arguments
correctly (except for loscil).
Thanks to Giorgio Zoia (ETH).

[2] Supports Borland C++ compiler
under Windows with very few warning
messages (thanks to Ross Bencina).

Version 0.38 -- 08/31/99 

[1] Supports Borland C++ compiler
under Windows with minimal warning
messages (thanks to Ross Bencina).

Version 0.37 -- 08/27/99 

[1] Many minor changes to support
compilation using Microsoft Visual
C++. 

[2] Bundles all libraries into the
sfront executable, so that the 
binary no longer needs to find the
library directory. 

Version 0.36 -- 08/20/99

[1] Adds linux audio <A HREF="../rtime/index.html#stream">output</A>
and audio and MIDI <A HREF="../rtime/index.html#rt">input</A>
support. 

[2] Core opcode rate semantics
now match saolc.

[3] Removes a printf option that
was not compatible with Microsoft
Visual C, increasing the odds sfront
may compile under Windows w/o UWIN
(thanks to gogins@nyc.pipeline.com).

Version 0.35 -- 07/29/99

Baseline version of sfront, future
entries in this log will describe
changes made to this release.
