<H1> Silicon Audition: Annotated Bibliography </H1>

<P> 
Between 1983 and 1997, my research centered on Silicon Audition: the
design of analog integrated circuits that model auditory
neurophysiology, and the use of these circuits in engineering
systems. This research was done in collaboration with many people at
several institutions: as an undergraduate working with Paul Mueller at
the University of Pennsylvania, as a graduate student working with
Carver Mead and Dick Lyon at Caltech, and as a postdoctoral fellow and
research scientist at UC Berkeley, working with John Wawryznek.
Grants from the Office of Naval Research and the National Science
Foundation funded the work at Berkeley.
</P>

<P>
This web page is an annotated bibliography of my silicon audition
research publications, including related work in analog circuit
design.  A <A HREF="bib.html">concise reverse-chronological
publication list</A> is also available.
</P>

<H1> The Penn Years: 1982-1984. </H1>

<P> As an undergraduate in Paul Mueller's lab, we worked on a
board-level circuit model of the cochlear nucleus: the final
system consisted of dozens of circuit boards full of SSI analog
components. We used the system in a simple phonetic speech
recognition system. We published an account of this research
in the following book, the conference proceedings of the first
Snowbird "Neural Networks for Computing Conference." An electronic
version of this publication is not available.

<H1> The Caltech Years: 1984-1990. </H1>

<P> As a graduate student in Carver Mead's lab, we focused on the
design of analog integrated circuits that model auditory
neurophysiology. Most of the systems use the silicon cochlea design
of Dick Lyon and Carver Mead as a core component. The simplest chip
adds circuits to the silicon cochlea to make a full model of sensory
transduction in the cochlea. The chip is described in this book
chapter, which is available as a PDF by clicking the title below.

barn owl, focusing on interaural time delay computations. This was
published in the journal Neural Computation, and as a book chapter;

with experimentalists at Dupont.

<H1> The Berkeley Years: 1991-1997. </H1>

<P>
At Berkeley, John Wawryznek and I focused on using the core
technologies of the Caltech years to create useful engineering
systems. One of our motivations was to leverage the low-power
potential of these earlier circuits, to create complete systems that
ran on microwatts of power; micropower performance is a capability
that the competing digital approach struggles to deliver. While most
of the circuit techniques used in the papers above are in fact
micropower, some are not; the publication below, presented at ISCAS
and in a book chapter, describes micropower replacements for these
circuits.

In real-world computing devices, efficient I/O is an important
consideration. In collaboration with researchers at several other
sites, we implemented and documented a novel technique for communication
neural representations off chip. This was presented at NIPS and was
published in IEEE Journal of Neural Networks.

<P> Using this communication scheme, we created a special-purpose
analog-to-digital converter chip, that takes analog input, processed
it through a silicon cochlea, a spectral-shape algorithm, and a
temporal adaptation algorithm, and sends the final representation off
chip efficiently. All parameters for the analog circuits are held on
chip in analog floating-gate cells, whose values can be digitally
programmed. We combined the chip with a workstation to generate a
real-time display of the sound representation. This system is
described in a paper published in IEEE Micro.</P>

<P> We used this multi-chip communications protocol in a second-generation
special-purpose analog-to-digital converter chip. This design let us
combine several copies of the same chip, tuned with different parameters,
to create a real-time auditory scene analysis system. We describe this
system in a NIPS paper.

We used this multi-chip system as a front-end for speaker-independent
speech recognition experiments, to verify that the system was usable
for a real engineering task.  These experiments are described in a
paper published in the journal Analog Integrated Circuits and Signal
Processing, and in a book chapter.

<P> This paper showed that a micropower analog integrated circuit
could be a useful front-end for speech recognition. But could an
entire speech recognition system be implemented in this technology?
A key element in such a system is a hidden Markov model (HMM) state
decoder. In collaboration with Richard Lippmann, we designed an
analog integrated circuit that implemented the HMM component of
a wordspotting algorithm. We presented this paper at NIPS, and it
appeared in the IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits.

<P> These papers showed the feasibility of integrating a complete
speech recognition system in analog VLSI. However, actually implementing
such a complex system is a daunting task. In collaboration with Richard
Lippmann, we developed an architecture to combine a small analog system
with a digital signal processor, to get most of the low-power benefits
of a full analog speech recognition implementation while simplifying the
analog part of the design.

In combining conventional speech recognition systems and biological

gap" limits the effectiveness of using auditory representations with
standard speech-recognition algorithms.  We discuss the nature of the
