<LI> WARP Connect.
<LI> The PMX server (The X Window System for OS/2) About $140 US,
availible from Indelible Blue, 800-776-8284, or
<LI> The Hummingbird X-server (commercial),  416-496-2200,

"local" Xserver for Log.
<LI>The <TT>icc</TT> compiler, and <TT>nmake</TT>. Not known if
<TT>gcc</TT> will work also, please let me know if you try <TT>gcc</TT>.
