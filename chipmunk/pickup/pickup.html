<H1> The Chipmunk Distribution </H1>

	<P> The current distribution of the Chipmunk tools was
released May 25, 2014.  It compiles and runs on Mac OS X Mavericks (
Apple LLVM Version 5.1) and on pre-clang Linux distributions (tested
on Red Hat Linux, 2.6.35 kernel, gcc 4.5.1), using the -m32 memory
model.  Please test this distribution on clang-based Linux
distributions and let us know how it works. Thanks to Michael Godfrey
for his contributions to this release.

	<P> In addition to Linux and OS X, the Chipmunk tools run on
a <A HREF="platforms.html"> wide </A> variety of platforms. Exact
software requirements vary by platform, but for most machines an ANSI
c compiler (most typically GCC), X11 (R4, R5, or R6), and an HTML
browser are the only requirements.

	<P> The most current version of the documentation is
accessible directly at the World-Wide Web sites that distribute the
Chipmunk tools. You can browse the manual without downloading the Web
tree.</P>

	<P> The Chipmunk distribution is offered with the GNU
license. In essence, GNU-licensed software is freely redistributable,
but if you make changes to the source code, and wish to distribute
your changes, you must also distribute the source code of your
modified version, and your modified source must also be freely
redistributable. Check the license agreement included with each
Chipmunk tool for more information.</P>

	<P> The Chipmunk tools are available in source form, as a set
of tar files, compressed with the GNU gzip program.  Practically all
users of the Chipmunk tools will need to get the following two
files. Click on the header name to download the tar file.</P>

<DL>
<DT> <A HREF="sources/webdoc-1.51.tar.gz">webdoc-1.51.tar.gz</A>
<DD> This file includes HTML documentation for all of the Chipmunk tools,
including manuals and installation information. All documentation previously
contained in individual Chipmunk tools has been rewritten as HTML or has been 
included as Postscript in this documentation tree.
<DT> <A HREF="sources/psys-1.61.tar.gz">psys-1.61.tar.gz</A>
<DD> This file is the source tree for the common libraries of all the 
X-based Chipmunk tools. Most machine-dependent aspects of the Chipmunk
system are contained in Psys.
