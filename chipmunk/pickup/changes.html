</UL>

<H1>Chipmunk Updates  -- May 1996</H1>

<H2>Improvements and Bug-Fixes</H2>

<UL>
<LI><B>Diglog schematic corruption bugfix.</B> A major bug that caused
Diglog to occasionally core dump on large hierarchial circuits has
been fixed; Diglog is safer to use for larger projects. [Ingo Cyliax
(Indiana University), Lars Larsson (Hamburg U.), Dave Gillespie]
<LI> <B>Lower load-averages for Log. </B> Log no longer runs a unity
load average indiscriminantly. If simulation is turned off, 
an analog circuit is "incomplete," or a diglog circuit is the null
schematic, Log will consume few cycles if the user isn't interacting
with the program. [Nick Bailey (U. Leeds, UK), Dave Gillespie]
<LI> <B>Analog gate improvements.</B> Bugs in the NPN1 and PNP1
bipolar transistors were found and fixed [Jamie Honan, Australia] as
were bugs in the Diode gate [Shudi Gu, Beijing].
<LI> <B>XNF file support.</B> New <A HREF="../document/log/logxnf/logxnf.html">
tools</A> for supporting Xilinx designs [Ingo Cyliax (Indiana University)].
<LI> <B>Log display support.</B> When launched on a machine with inadequate or
unsupported display hardware, Log reverts to monochrome display
instead of core-dumping [Huiling, CSU Fresno].
</UL>

<H2>Ports (<A HREF="platforms.html">updated platform list</A>)</H2>
<UL>
<LI> <B> MachTen. </B> Analog now runs under MachTen, a BSD 
for MacOS. [James Yang, UC Davis]
<LI> <B> Updates for existing platforms. </B> SGI [John Krivitsky,
Curtin University of Technology], FreeBSD [Mark N. Martin, Johns
Hopkins], and Linux [Luc Claeys, Belgium, Aubrey Jaffer, MIT] had
compatibility problems fixed.
<LI> <B>MS-DOS</B> Alpha release available for the MS-DOS port of Log
[Luigi Rizzo and collaborators, University of Pisa, Italy].

<H1> New Chipmunk Features -- February 1995</H1>

	<P> One major change for 1995 is the conversion of most
Chipmunk documentation into HTML, and the integration of these files
into a unified system with many cross-links. </P>

	<P> Other major changes are ports to new architectures, and
updates to existing ports to maintain compatibility with changing
operating systems. Here is the list of support changes for this
release, along with the contributor(s). </P>

<UL>
<LI> <B>OS/2.</B> Mike Godfrey of the Information Systems Laboratory at
Stanford University ported the Psys and Log packages to OS/2. Other 
packages remain to be ported, but the Psys port should make these ports
much easier to accomplish.
<LI> <B>Sun Solaris 2.X.</B> Reinhard Koehn of TU-Berlin ported Log and Psys
packages to Solaris 2.X running under the SPARC processor architecture. 
The other tools seem to compile well in the Solaris 2.X environment, but I
haven't tested them thoroughly. Solaris 1.X (SunOS 4.X) support 
is unaffected by this port.
<LI>  <B> FreeBSD.</B> Dan Andersson of the Chalmers University of Technology
(Sweden) ported the Chipmunk tools to FreeBSD; John Utz
at the University of Washington and Luigi Rizzo at the Universita' di Pisa
also contributed to the port. 
<LI> <B> SGI. </B> Tor Sverre Lande at IFI in Oslo ported the Chipmunk
tools to a SGI Challenger, and Michael Morrison of the University of
Iowa ported the tools to an SGI machine running IRIX. I combined these
two ports, and tested the result on an Indigo. All the tools seem to
work, but I haven't tested them thoroughly.
<LI>  <B> IBM RS/6000. </B> Fernando Pineda of the Applied Physics Lab
at Johns-Hopkins updated the Chipmunk distribution to compile on more
recent OS versions for the IBM RS/6000, building on the earlier port by
Gary Liu of Caltech. I tested Fernando's port on a RS/6000 and it seemed
to work. 
<LI>  <B> Linux. </B> Geir Harris Hedemark at IFI at Norway, and Jack Zvonik
of TRW in Redondo Beach updated the Linux port to work under more recent
Slackware distributions.
<LI> <B> HP 700 Series. </B> All Chipmunk tools now compile with gcc on HP
700 series workstations. It's no longer necessary to use the HP compiler,
with the extra-cost ANSI option, in order to run Chipmunk on HP 700 series
machines. 
</UL>
	
	<P> In addition to these ports, several new features were added to
various Chipmunk tools: </P>

<UL>

<LI> <B>Postscript updates.</B> All Chipmunk tools now produce
encapsulated postscript that is compatible with the psfig macros
distributed with TeX.  John Platt and Dave Gillespie of Synaptics,
Michael Godfrey at ISL, Himanshu R. Pota of ADFA in Australia, and
gary@minster.york.ac.uk contributed to these improvements.
<LI> <B>Logspc updates.</B> Harold Levy of Caltech contributed a new
version of Logspc, the SPICE netlist tool for Log, that contains new
features and bug fixes.
<LI> <B>MATLAB support.</B> Michael Godfrey of ISL contributed a filter
program for converting data files produced by Log into files suitable for
MATLAB.
<LI> <B> New CIF tools.</B> Several new tools are included for CIF
filtering, including Boxify by Tor Sverre Lande.
<LI> <B>Improved documentation.</B> Michael Godfrey of ISL contributed
several new Postscript documents for documenting Log, included a detailed
explanation of the MOS models currently used in analog.
<LI> <B>Major DigLog bugfix.</B> Micah Beck of the University of
Tennessee helped trace down a major bug in DigLog, that was
responsible for schematic corruption of large files. Many users were
bitten by this bug in the past. Until new users report back, we won't
know for sure if this change completely solves schematic corruption
for large designs when DigLog simulation is occuring: it's hard to
test for bugs that only occur only in large designs.
</UL>
	<P> In addition to these major improvements, lots of little
bug fixes and enhancements have been added in the release. </P>
