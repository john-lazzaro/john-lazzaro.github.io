<TITLE> Compiling Psys </TITLE>

<H1> Compiling Psys </H1>

	<P> This document assumes you are compiling the Psys libraries
for one of the currently <A HREF="../pickup/platforms.html"> supported </A>
machines, and that you have the required support software detailed
in this document. This document also assumes that you have uncompressed
and untarred the <TT> Psys </TT> file, and installed it in the 
<TT> chipmunk </TT> directory. </P>

	<P> Begin by descending to the <TT> psys/src </TT> directory. 
At this point OS/2 users <B> only </B> should execute the following
command. </P>

<P> <TT> cp Makefile.os2 Makefile </TT> </P>

	<P> All users should now edit the Makefile, and make any
necessary changes. Comments in the Makefile will guide you through 
these changes; the changes are labeled with the markers (1), (2), (3), 
etc. Once these changes are made, execute the command </P>

<P> <TT> make install </TT> </P>

	<P> If things are working correctly, a long series of compilations,
linkings, and file movements should occur without error. When these 
operations complete, Psys is successfully installed. </P>

<H1> Problems and Solutions </H1>

<P> It is quite possible that compilation did not proceed smoothly. Here are
some problems that could have happened, along with suggestions.
</P>

<DL>
<DT> <B> ANSI header problems </B>
<DD> Sometimes, not all the <TT>/usr/include/*.h</TT> files are ANSI
standard, especially in older machines.  Symptoms of this problem
include mention of the <TT>stdlib.h</TT> and <TT>stddef.h</TT> header
files in the compilation error message, and mention of the <TT>_SIZE_T</TT> and
<TT>_PTRDIFF_T</TT> defines in the compilation error message. There are several
possible <A HREF="psysansi.html">solutions </A> to this problem.
<DT> <B> Ranlib problems </B>
<DD> On some systems, it may be necessary to run <TT>ranlib</TT> on the
file <TT>libp2c.a</TT> for linking to be successfull. 
<DT> <B> Font problems </B> 
<DD> The Chipmunk system expects the X fonts
<TT>8x13</TT>and <TT>6x10</TT> to be available. Some minimal systems
don't have these. If you don't have them, edit the section of the
<tt>psys</TT> Makefile that configures the default fonts, and change the
definitions to be similarly-sized fonts that are in your system.
<DT> <B> Gcc installation problems </B> 
<DD> Sometimes Gcc is installed incorrectly in a system, and the
Chipmunk tools are the first program that reveal the incorrect
installation. Examples problems include Gcc using the cc preprocessor
instead of its own preprocessor, and Gcc is looking in the wrong place
for include files. When compiling the Chipmunk tools, a symptom of
these problems often involves problems with accessing the system
include file <TT>varargs.h.</TT>
<DT> <B> Putc definition problems (Linux users only) </B>
<DD> The <TT>putc</TT> definition in <TT>newcrt.c</TT> is set up for
the current Slackware distribution of Linux. If <TT>newcrt.c</TT> does
not compile for you under Linux, search in <TT>newcrt.c</TT> for the
word <TT>dreaded</TT> for more information.
<DT> <B> Make hangs (OS/2 users only) </B>
<DD> Be sure to use <TT>nmake</TT>, not <TT>make</TT>.
