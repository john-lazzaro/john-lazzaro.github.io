<H1> Compiling Wolcomp </H1>

	<P> This document assumes that you have successfully compiled
the <A HREF="psys.html"> Psys </A> libraries.  This
document also assumes that you have uncompressed and untarred the 
Wolcomp file, and installed it in the <TT>chipmunk</TT>
directory. Note that Wolcomp has not been ported to OS/2.</P>

	<P> Begin by descending to the <TT>wolcomp</TT> directory.
Edit the file <TT>Makefile,</TT> and make any necessary
changes. Comments in <TT>Makefile</TT> will guide you through these
changes; the changes are labeled with the markers (1), (2), (3),
etc. Once these changes are made, execute the command </P>

<P> <TT> make install </TT> </P>

	<P> If things are working correctly, a long series of
compilations, linkings, and file movements should occur without error.
The Wolcomp library <TT> wolcomp.a </TT> is now ready to be included in
cell compilers.  To learn more about using wolcomp, see the <A
HREF="../document/wol/index.html"> user documentation. </A> </P>
