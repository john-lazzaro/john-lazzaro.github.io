<H1> Compiling Netcmp </H1>

	<P> This document assumes that you have successfully compiled
the <A HREF="psys.html"> Psys </A> libraries. This document also
assumes that you have uncompressed and untarred the Netcmp
file, and installed it in the <TT>chipmunk</TT> directory. Note that
Netcmp has not been ported to OS/2.</P>

	<P> Begin by descending to the <TT>netcmp</TT> directory.
Edit the file <TT>Makefile,</TT> and make any necessary
changes. Comments in the Makefile will guide you through these
changes; the changes are labeled with the markers (1), (2), (3),
etc. Once these changes are made, execute the command </P>

<P> <TT> make install </TT> </P>

	<P> If things are working correctly, a long series of
compilations, linkings, and file movements should occur without error.
This will create the program <TT> chipmunk/bin/netcmp.</TT> To do a quick
test of netcmp, execute the following command from the 
<TT>chipmunk/netcmp</TT> directory: </P>

<P> <TT> netcmp test1.ntk test2.ntk </TT></P>

<P> Many lines of text should follow, ending with the line </P>

<P> <TT> No differences found. </TT></P>

<P> To learn more about using netcmp, see the <A
HREF="../document/wol/index.html"> user documentation. </A> </P>

suggestions; press <A HREF="helpme.html"> here </A> for more
