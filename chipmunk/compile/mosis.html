<H1> Compiling Mosis </H1>

	<P> This document assumes that you have successfully compiled
the <A HREF="psys.html"> Psys </A> libraries.  This
document also assumes that you have uncompressed and untarred the 
Mosis file, and installed it in the <TT>chipmunk</TT>
directory. Note that Mosis has not been ported to OS/2.</P>

	<P> Begin by descending to the <TT>mosis</TT> directory.
No <TT>Makefile</TT> customization is necessary. However, customization
of the file <TT>mosis.c</TT> is necessary, since details in the
desired mailing file (account #, name, address, etc) are very site
dependent. </P>

	<P> To do this customization, edit the file <TT>mosis.c</TT>,
and search for all instances of the word <TT>CUSTOM.</TT> This word
will be in comments next to <TT>printf</TT> statements that print
site-specific parts of the MOSIS header file. If you have sent a chip
out to MOSIS manually you will recognize these lines; if not, you should
ask a more experienced person for assistance. </P>

	<P> After this customization has been done,  execute the command </P>

<P> <TT> make install </TT> </P>

	<P> If things are working correctly, a short series of
compilations, linkings, and file movements should occur without error.
The program <TT>chipmunk/bin/mosis</TT> will be created, ready for
use to send mail messages to MOSIS. To learn about using this program, see
the <A HREF="../document/wol/index.html"> user documentation. </A> </P>

<P> If you have problems compiling or using this program, I'd be happy to
offer suggestions; press <A HREF="helpme.html"> here </A> for more
information about asking for help. </P>
