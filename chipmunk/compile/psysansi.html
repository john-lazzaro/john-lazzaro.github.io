<H1> ANSI Header Problems in Psys </H1>


<P> Symptoms of ANSI header problems include mention of the
<TT>stdlib.h</TT> and <TT>stddef.h</TT> header files in the error
message, and mention of the <TT>_SIZE_T</TT> and <TT>_PTRDIFF_</TT>T
defines in the error message. There are several possible solutions to
this problem, depending on your machine configuration; they are listed
in order of probability of working: </P>

<OL>
<LI> Make a file <TT>stdlib.h</TT> in the directory
<TT>psys/include,</TT> that contains one line: the string
<TT>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;.</TT> This file may help for the
compilation of some files but break the compilation of other files; if
so, delete and re-make the file as needed.
<LI> Undo the change described in 1. above, and add <TT>-D_SIZE_T
-D_PTRDIFF_T</TT> to the <TT>CFLAGS</TT> definition in the Makefile.
<LI>  Undo the change described in 2. above, and add the empty files 
<TT>stddef.h</TT> and <TT>stdlib.h</TT> in the directory 
<TT>psys/include.</TT>  These files may help for the
compilation of some files but break the compilation of other files; if
so, delete and re-make the files as needed.
</OL>

<P> Please send me email if you needed to use the information on this
page. I'm pretty sure this particular bug never happens in the field
anymore, it primarily affects SunOS users with early Sparcstations that
have never had software upgrades. </P>
