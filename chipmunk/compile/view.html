<H1> Compiling View </H1>

	<P> This document assumes that you have successfully compiled
the <A HREF="psys.html"> Psys </A> libraries.  This
document also assumes that you have uncompressed and untarred the <TT>
View </TT> file, and installed it in the <TT> chipmunk </TT>
directory. Note that view has not been ported to OS/2.</P>

	<P> Begin by descending to the <TT> view </TT> directory.
Edit the file <TT> Makefile, </TT> and make any necessary
changes. Comments in the Makefile will guide you through these
changes; the changes are labeled with the markers (1), (2), (3),
etc. Once these changes are made, execute the command </P>

<P> <TT> make install </TT> </P>

	<P> If things are working correctly, a long series of
compilations, linkings, and file movements should occur without error.
This will create the program <TT> chipmunk/bin/vc. </TT> The name
is changed from <TT> view </TT> during the copy to <TT> chipmunk/bin/ </TT>
because an existing Unix tool uses that name. </P>

<P>To do a quick test, start view by executing <TT> chipmunk/bin/vc </TT>
and typing the following test program into the program. </P>

<P> <TT> basis i = 1:10:1</TT> </P>
<P> <TT> y = i*i</TT> </P>
<P> <TT> fplot i y </TT> </P>
<P> <TT> quit</TT> </P>

<P>After the "fplot" command, a window should pop up with the curves, one
a straight line and one a curve. To learn more about using view, see the
<A HREF="../document/view/index.html"> user documentation. </A> </P>

<H1> Problems and Solutions </H1>

<P> Its quite possible that compilation did not proceed smoothly, or
that execution problems happen while using the tool.  Here are some
possible ways that things could have went wrong, along with
suggestions.  </P>

<DL>
<DT> <B> Plotting doesn't work </B>
<DD> If you have a monochrome machine, you will notice a bug in the plotting
routines that results in blank on-screen plots. I've spent some time trying
to find this without success. Note that the problem is purely in display;
Postscript produced by the plot portion of view will be correct, but you'll
be flying blind while creating the plot.
</DL>

<P> The view source distribution includes routines for using view as a
test instrument control environment using GPIB. These routines are no
longer used by the maintainer, but are included in the package as a
starting point for someone to continue development on the GPIB portion
of view. The directories <TT> mt/ </TT> and <TT> tek2430/ </TT> are
there for GPIB users, and can be safely ignored by everyone else. If
you have an HPIB card in your workstation and want to try resurrecting
these tools, type <TT> make clean myinstall </TT> in the <TT>view</TT>
directory, and be prepared to start detective work! </P>

<P> If you have problems compiling view, or need guidance in a GPIB
development, I'd be happy to offer suggestions; press <A
