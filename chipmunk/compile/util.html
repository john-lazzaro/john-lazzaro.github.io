<H1> Compiling the Supplementary Tools </H1>

	<P> This document assumes that you have successfully compiled
the <A HREF="psys.html"> Psys </A> libraries.  This document also
assumes that you have uncompressed and untarred the Util file that
holds the supplementary tools, and installed it in the
<TT>chipmunk</TT> directory.</P>

	<P> The 1995 release is the first release of the supplementary
toolkit. Many of the tools were contributed by the Chipmunk tool
users, who may have only used them on a few platforms. As a result,
compiling and running these tools may not be as smooth as the other
Chipmunk tools. </P>

	<P> Begin by descending to the <TT>util</TT> directory.Then cd
to each subdirectory, and edit the file <TT>Makefile</TT>, and make
any necessary changes. Comments in the <TT>Makefile</TT> will guide you
through these changes; the changes are labeled with the markers (1),
(2), (3), etc. Once these changes are made in each directory, return
to <TT>util</TT> and execute the command </P>

<P> <TT>make install</TT> </P>

	<P> If things are working correctly, a long series of
compilations, linkings, and file movements should occur without error.
This will create the programs and shell scripts in the directory
<TT>chipmunk/bin/.</TT> </P> 

<P> To learn more about the Supplementary tools, see the <A
HREF="../document/other/index.html"> user documentation. </A> </P>

<P> If you have problems compiling or using these tools, I'd be happy to
offer suggestions; press <A HREF="helpme.html"> here </A> for more
information about asking for help. For many types of problems, I'll
probably refer you to the contributing author for the tool.</P>
