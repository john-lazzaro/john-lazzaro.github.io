<TITLE> Setting up the Chipmunk System </TITLE>

<H1> Chipmunk System Setup </H1>

	<P> The first part of setting up a Chipmunk system is to
choose a place in your directory tree for the tools. Chipmunk can be
installed in a user directory; you do not need to install it in a
public place like <TT> /usr/local/.</TT>  Once you've decided on a
place, create a directory called <TT>chipmunk.</TT> Now move all
the Chipmunk tar files to the <TT>chipmunk</TT> directory, and
uncompress them using <TT>gzip</TT> if necessary.</P>

	<P> Next, un-tar the files using the <TT>tar</TT> command,
with the options appropriate for your system. For most Unix systems,
the command </P>

<P> <TT>tar -xf file.tar</TT> </P>

<P> untars the file <TT>file.tar.</TT> Once this is complete, a
directory listing of <TT>chipmunk</TT> should include the following
directories </P>
 
<P> <TT>webdoc/ psys/</TT> </P>

<P> as well as some of the following directories, depending on which 
applications you pickup up. </P>

<P> <TT>log/ mosis/ netcmp/ until/ util/ view/ wol/ wolcomp/</TT> </P>

<P> <A NAME="place"> At </a> this point, you may wish to continue
reading these instructions from the copy of this text in 
<TT>webdoc/.</TT> The file you are reading is 
<TT>chipmunk/webdoc/compile/compile.html#place.</TT> You can use the <I>
Open Local </I> command in your WEB browser to find and open this
file. </P>

<H2> Chipmunk Compilation </H2>

<P> Psys is the first package you should compile; press 
<A HREF="psys.html"> here </A> for instructions on compiling the
Psys package. Once Psys is compiled, you should proceed to compile the
other tools in your Chipmunk directory. </P>

<P> The compilation process for Psys also creates the directory 
<TT>chipmunk/bin.</TT> The compilation process for all the Chipmunk tools
will deposit executables in this directory. Users of Chipmunk tools
should put this directory in their path. The compilation process for
Psys also creates the directory <TT>chipmunk/lib.</TT> Many (but not
all) Chipmunk tools deposit configuration and example files in this
directory. </P>

<P> Once Psys is compiled, you can compile the other Chipmunk tools in
any order you like. Click on the package name below for compilation
instructions for this package: </P>

<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="log.html"> Log</A> 
<LI> <A HREF="view.html">View</A> 
<LI> <A HREF="until.html">Until</A> 
<LI> <A HREF="wol.html">Wol</A> 
<LI> <A HREF="wolcomp.html">Wolcomp</A>

<LI> <A HREF="mosis.html">Mosis</A> 
<LI> <A HREF="util.html">Supplementary Tools</A> 
</UL>

<P> Finally, you may want to retrieve a global Makefile for the entire
Chipmunk toolset, so that you can recompile all the tools with a
single command.  Click 
<A HREF="http://john-lazzaro.github.io/chipmunk/pickup/sources/Makefile"
>here</a> to view the Makefile, and use the <B>Save As</B> feature of
your browser to pick up a copy.  Press <A HREF="makefile.html">
here </A> for information about customizing and using the
Makefile. </P>

<P>Once the tools are installed, you can start exploring the 
<A HREF="../document/document.html">user documentation </A> for the
Chipmunk tools. </P>
