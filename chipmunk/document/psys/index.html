<H1> Chipmunk and X: Color Depth </H1>

<P> Chipmunk tools currently support monochrome, 8-bit, 16-bit, and
24-bit displays. The 16-bit and 24-bit display modes are only known to
work on the PC architecture (X11 under Linux and OS/2); see this <A
HREF= "modes.html"> document </A> for more details on the current
status of color support. </P>

<P> By default, the Chipmunk tools select a color mode using these rules: </P>

<UL>
<LI> If Pseudo-Color mode is supported with a depth of at least 8 bits,
the tool uses 8-bit mode. 
<LI> If Pseudo-Color mode is not supported but TrueColor mode is 
supported, the tool uses 24-bit depth if available, or 16-bit depth
if 24-bit depth is not available.
<LI> If all else fails, monochrome mode is selected. 
</UL>

<P> The user can force the color mode of a Chipmunk tool by setting
the environment variable <TT>LOG_COLOR</TT> to be the string
<TT>bw</TT> or <TT>8bit</TT> or <TT>16bit</TT> or <TT>24bit</TT>. </P>

<H1> Chipmunk and X: Window Placement and Fonts </H1>

<P> Manually placing and sizing the <TT>mylib</TT> and <TT>newcrt</TT>
windows can quickly become tedious. The Chipmunk
tools can automatically size and place these windows. To enable this
feature, you'll need to add information to an X initialization file in
your home directory, typically named <TT>.Xresources</TT>. Three
resources are implemented for the Chipmunk tools:

<DL>
<DT> <TT>mylib.geometry: =AxB+C+D</TT>
<DD> You can use this resource to set the size of the <TT>mylib</TT>
window to have an X dimension of A pixels, and a Y dimension of B pixels,
and have it automatically placed at the position indicated by C (x placement)
and D (y placement). 
<DT> <TT>newcrt.geometry: +C+D</TT>
<DD> The size of the <TT>newcrt</TT> window is fixed for all Chipmunk tools.
This resource automatically places the <TT>newcrt</TT>
window at a position indicated by C (x placement) and D (y placement). 
<DT> <TT>mylib.color black_and_white</TT>
<DD> This X resource forces Chipmunk tools to generate monochrome 
displays, even if the machine has a color monitor. 
</DL>

<P> By default, the <TT>mylib</TT> window uses the <TT>6x10</TT> font
and the <TT>newcrt</TT> window uses the <TT>8x13</TT> font.  On some X
servers, these fonts may not be available. These resources change the
default fonts:</P>

<DL>
<DT> <TT>mylib.font: fontname</TT>
<DT> <TT>newcrt.font: fontname</TT>
</DL>

<P> Alternatively, the default fonts may be specified at compile-time
in the <tt>psys</TT> Makefile.</P>

<P> 
After changing the <TT>.Xresources</TT> file, run <TT>xrdb -merge
.Xresources</TT> to activate the new behaviors.  If this command does
not update your X server, you should exit and restart the X server.
</P>

<H2> Examples </H2>

<P> My <TT>.Xresources</TT> for my color Sun IPC machine is as
follows: </P>

<P><TT>mylib.geometry: =1150x550+0+0</TT></P> 
<P><TT>newcrt.geometry: +510+586</TT></P>

<P> My <TT>.Xresources</TT> for my HP 712/80 machine, which
has a higher-resolution monitor, is </P>

<P><TT>mylib.geometry: =1278x682+0+0</TT></P> 
<P><TT>newcrt.geometry: +638+710</TT></P>

<P> Some versions of the NX server do not have the default
Chipmunk fonts available.  The <TT>.Xresources</TT> entries
below remedy the situation: </P>

<P> <TT>mylib.font: 6x13</P>
<P> <TT>newcrt.font: 6x13</P>

<P> These features were added to the Chipmunk tools by Jim Clark at
Harvard University, Tor Sverre Lande at IFI, and Michael Godfrey at
Stanford University. Thanks to Derek Woolverton for documentation
updates.</P>
