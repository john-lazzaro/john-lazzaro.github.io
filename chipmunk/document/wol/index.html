<H1> Documentation for Wol </H1>

<P> Documentation for Wol consists of a long manual, written by Mass
Sivilotti, in Postscript. These manuals are basically untouched from
the pre-Unix version of Wol, and are in need of updating and
HTML conversion. The manual covers other tools, such as Netcmp,
Wolcomp, and Mosis, as well as Wol.  </P>

Wolcomp. Note that this manual covers the pre-Unix version of Wolcomp,
describing a library embedded in Pascal instead of C.

<P>To help understand how to use Wolcomp and Wol in a real chip
design, with the current version of the tools, serious users will want
to check out the examples package, which contains a VLSI chip design
done using Wol and Wolcomp. Press <A HREF=
"../../pickup/pickup.html"> here </A> for information on picking up
the examples package. </P>
