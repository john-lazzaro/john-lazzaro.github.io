<H1> Scope_to_mat </H1>
<H2> An anaLOG scope dump to Matlab .mat file converter </H2>

<H2> <TT>Usage: scope_to_mat filename </TT></H2>

<P>You should have dumped some variables from anaLOG scope mode using
``dump'' and given the file a name (no extension). anaLOG will have
created a file: <TT>filename.text</TT>.  Scope_to_mat will read this
file and create a <TT>filename.mat</TT> file. The .mat format is used
by the Matlab's ``save'' command; it is a dump of the current
workspace.  Thus, after running scope_to_mat, you can enter Matlab and
then execute: load filename. At this point the Matlab ``who'' command
should list the variable names that were present on the scope back in
anaLOG.  There will always be a variable ``TIME'' in the file, as
anaLOG writes this as a record of the time points at which the other
variables were recorded and plotted on the scope (sort of the scope
horizontal axis).  Notice that the values of the variable ``TIME'' do
not increase by constant increments. </P>
