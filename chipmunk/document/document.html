<H1> Chipmunk System Documentation </H1>

<P> Previous versions of the Chipmunk tools have included a
disorganized set of manuals, in various formats, scattered throughout
the distribution.  Much of the text in the documents dated back to <A
HREF="../describe/hp9836.html"> pre-Unix </A> versions of the
software. This version of the Chipmunk documentation tree marks a
first step towards cleaning up the documentation for the Chipmunk
tools. The eventual goal is to have up-to-date, cross-referenced
manuals entirely written in HTML. </P>

<P> The Chipmunk documentation is divided into the following
sections. For each section, click on the section title for the
manual. Other links lead to brief descriptions of the tools. </P>

contained in this manual collection. I'd be happy to integrate additional
documentation into this manual as I receive them. </P>
