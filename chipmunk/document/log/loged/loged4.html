<H1>  LABEL command</H1>

<PRE>

   1.  To edit the text shown when the user taps on a gate in CNFG mode,
       use the LABEL command.  This command runs a simple text editor.
       To exit the editor, press Control-C.

   2.  The labels editor lets you move the cursor with the arrow keys,
       delete or insert a line using the Control-F and RETURN keys, insert
       characters, or erase characters with Control-G.  (Currently, there
       is no way to recover a deleted line, or to move or copy lines except
       by retyping them.)

   3.  Any line without a colon (":") is displayed as-is on the screen
       when the gate is configured.  To include a colon in a label, use
       a double colon ("::").

   4.  If a line does contain a colon, it describes an attribute.
       Everything to the left of the colon is a coded string showing
       the name, type, and default value of the attribute.  Everything
       after the colon is shown as-is as the label for the attribute.
       Blanks are ignored between parts of the attribute information.

            <name> <variant> <precision> <type> <default> ':' <label>

   5.  The name is optional, and must be enclosed in square brackets.
       Actually, several bracketed names may be used if for some
       reason the attribute must have several names.  The code for a
       gate may refer to an attribute by its name, or by an integer
       index ranging from 1 to the number of attributes.

   6.  The type is a single capital letter.  The following types are
       defined:

            I     Integer.  If a precision is given, the number is
                  blank-padded to at least that width when displayed.
                  If a default is given, it becomes the initial value
                  of the attribute for newly created gates.  If there
                  is no default, the attribute is initially blank.

            H     Hexadecimal integer.  The number is zero-padded to at
                  least the specified width; if no precision is given
                  but there is a default, the precision is equal to the
                  number of digits in the default.

            R     Real number.  The precision gives the number of decimal
                  places shown on the number; if no precision is given
                  the number will be shown in floating format.  Large
                  and small numbers are shown in scientific notation.

            U     Real number with units.  The default is of the form,

                        <units-string> ',' <default>

                  where the comma and default may be omitted if the
                  attribute should be blank by default.  The number is
                  shown followed by the units-string; large and small
                  numbers are shown using standard engineering notation
                  abbreviations.  The attribute:

                        [clock-freq] 2FHz,10000:Clock frequency::

                  will display its default as "10KHz".

            F     Real number with units, scientific notation.  This is
                  just like "U" format except large and small numbers
                  are shown in scientific notation with the units-string
                  appended.

            C     String attribute.  The precision specifies the number
                  of characters of length the string may have; with no
                  precision the string length is unlimited.  The default
                  may be any string of characters, unmodified except that
                  leading and trailing blanks are removed.

            A     String attribute.  To the user, this is just like a
                  "C" type attribute with no precision specified.
                  Internally, this is stored as a variable-length
                  string, whereas a "C" type attribute is stored as a
                  fixed length string.  Precision is ignored.

            B     Boolean value.  The default may be "Y" or "N" (or "T"
                  or "F") to specify true or false.  If the default is
                  blank (or "X"), the attribute is initially blank.
                  If the default is "T" or "F" or "X", the attribute is
                  displayed as "True" or "False".  If the default is
                  "Y" or "N" or blank, the attribute is displayed as
                  "Yes" or "No".

            V     Variant.  This attribute represents a choice among
                  several named options.  The default string is actually
                  a sequence of comma-separated phrases.  These phrases
                  are numbered from 0.  The precision actually specifies
                  the default variant shown; with no precision, variant 0
                  is the default.  If the attribute should be able to be
                  blank, simply leave one of the phrases empty.

                        1 V , Yes, No, Maybe : What do you think?

                  This attribute takes on one of the four values blank,
                  Yes, No, or Maybe; it is initially Yes.

   7.  A variant name may be included in any attribute, followed by a
       semicolon.  The name must be one of the options for a variant
       attribute that precedes this attribute in the list.  The attribute
       will be invisible unless the proper variant was selected.

            V Square,Circle: Kind of shape::
            Square; R:Width::
            Square; R:Height::
            Circle; R:Radius::

   8.  If the type letter is preceded by the letter 'O', the attribute is
       optional and can be made blank by typing a blank line.  An attribute
       with no default is always optional.  If the attribute has a default
       and is not optional, then it must always have a nonblank value.  (This
       is true even of string attributes.)  Entering a blank line for a
       nonoptional attribute restores the default value.
