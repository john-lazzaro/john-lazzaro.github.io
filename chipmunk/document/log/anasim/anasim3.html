   1.  DC.  This is just a constant amount of voltage or current.

   2.  Pulse.  Depending on how you set it up, this can be a square wave,
       triangle, or sawtooth.  Referring to the attributes for Pulse mode,
       the output waveform starts at "initial voltage," then, after
       "delay time" (plus "reset time" for the first cycle), it begins
       ramping to "pulsed voltage," at a rate determined by "rise time."
       It stays at that voltage for "pulse width," then ramps back to the
       "initial voltage" in "fall time."  The cycle repeats the the period
       specified.  NOTES:  If rise and fall time are both relatively
       small, you get a square wave.  If one is large and the other small,
       you get a sawtooth.  If both are large, and the pulse width is zero,
       you get a triangle.

   3.  Sine.  This generates a sine wave, with the frequency, offset, and
       amplitude desired.  The "phase" is specified in degrees.  If the
       "delay" is nonzero, the wave waits that amount of time after RESET
       before it begins to change.

   4.  Stairs.  Starts at "initial voltage," waits there for "time per
       step" time, then ramps to next voltage in time "rise/fall time."
       This occurs "number of steps" times, for a total of "steps"+1
       voltages between "initial voltage" and "ending voltage,"
       inclusive.  After the cycle, it ramps all the way back to
       "initial voltage," again in "rise/fall time," and starts over.
       If "initial delay" is nonzero, the waveform remains constant
       for that long before beginning.

   5.  Bistable switch.  If the switch is "off," output is "initial
       voltage."  If it is "on," output is "pulsed voltage."  When the
       switch is changed, output switches from initial to pulsed
       voltage in time "rise time," or from pulsed to initial voltage
       in time "fall time" (regardless of whether the voltage was
       actually increasing or decreasing).  On RESET, the switch is
       set to on or off according to "reset state."

   6.  Monostable switch.  Output is normally "initial voltage."  When
       switch is tapped, output ramps to "pulsed voltage" in time
       "rise time," holds for "pulse width," them ramps back in time
       "fall time."
