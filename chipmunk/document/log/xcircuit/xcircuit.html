<P> Tim Edwards (tim@bach.ece.jhu.edu) has developed a tool that
generates publication-quality Postscript schematics from an lgf
file. In contrast, the Postscript created by Log itself is typically
draft-quality.  He maintains this tool, and hosts it at an FTP site
at the Johns Hopkins University. Click <A
