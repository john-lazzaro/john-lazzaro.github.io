<PRE>

   1.  LOG reads the file "log.cnf" every time it starts up.  If you do
       not have one in the current directory, it uses "/lib/log/log.cnf".
       You can give the "-c" command-line switch to specify your own
       configuration file.  The "use log" script actually loads the
       program "diglog" into the computer and aliases the "log" command
       to "diglog -cdlog", causing "dlog.cnf" (in the current directory
       or in /lib/log) to be used.  Similarly, "use analog" loads the
       program "analog" and aliases "log" to "analog -calog".

   2.  To create your own configuration file, the best approach is to
       make a file named "log.cnf", "alog.cnf", or "dlog.cnf", whichever
       is appropriate, in your current directory.  In that file, put a
       line something like "include /lib/log/alog.cnf", followed by any
       additional commands to override the system defaults.  Do not
       copy the system CNF files if you can avoid it; these files are
       subject to change at any time.

   3.  For example, your CNF file might look like this:

               { A comment saying what this is used for }
               include /lib/log/dlog.cnf     { Inherit from Digital LOG }
               gates + ~me/log/mygates       { Add on my own gates file }
               menu a b c d e vdd gnd        { Choose my own menu gates }
               glow on                       { Turn on "glow" mode }

       In this example, the "+" in the GATES command means to add the
       name(s) to the existing list of gates files.  Since the MENU
       command does not have a "+", it replaces the list from the
       other file.  This notation works with the GATES, GET, GETGROUP,
       and MENU commands in configuration files.

   4.  The following ":" commands may also be used in a "log.cnf"
       configuration file:

           AVOID         GLOWSOLDER    OFF           QUIET
           COLOR         GROUP         ON            RESPONSE
           CONFLICT      INVISIBLE     SIM           SNAP
           DOTS          INVLABEL      POPUP         VERBOSE
           GLOW          MACRO         PROBE

   5.  The following additional commands are allowed in configuration
       files:


       BOBCAT  command-line
       CHIPMUNK  command-line
                  Process the command only if LOG is being run on the
                  specified kind of computer.  The "command-line" here
                  is any of the commands listed in this section; in other
                  words, the words BOBCAT and CHIPMUNK are prefixes that
                  can be added to any command in a CNF file.


       COMMAND  toolname  command command command ...
                  Register that the listed commands are handled by the
                  indicated tool.  If a command is given and its owning
                  tool has not been initialized, that tool will be
                  initialized.

       DO command-line
                  Add the command-line to a list of ":" commands to be
                  done as soon as LOG is started.  These commands are
                  executed as if typed from the keyboard, i.e., they
                  may be commands which are ordinarily forbidden in
                  CNF files.  The "DO" commands are executed in the
                  order they originally appeared in the CNF files.


       GATES filename filename filename ...
                  Register the specified ".gate" files into the LOG
                  gate library.  Files are searched for a given gate
                  starting at the first filename of the first GATES
                  command in the CNF file.  Ordinarily, the presence
                  of the first GATES command in a given CNF file
                  overrides all GATES commands in previously read
                  CNF files (i.e., INCLUDE files).  If the first
                  word after GATES is "+", the listed filenames will
                  instead be added to the existing list of gates
                  files.  If no explicit directory is given, LOG
                  looks first in the current directory, then in
                  the "home" directory, then in /lib/log.  If the
                  gates file is not found, it is ignored.


       GET gate gate gate ...
                  Load the specified gates into the gate catalog.  The
                  gate names may include wildcard characters "*" and "?",
                  and may also specify one or more group numbers from
                  0 to 8:  "GET A*;34" gets all gates whose names begin
                  with A, which are found on pages 3 or 4 of the Library.
                  If this is the first GET command in its CNF file, it
                  overrides any previous GET commands from other files
                  unless GET is followed by the word "+".  (The obsolete
                  word LOAD is accepted as a synonym for GET.)


       GETGROUP gate gate gate ...
                  Load the specified group of gates into the gate catalog.
                  This like a normal GET command, except the gates are
                  guaranteed to be placed together (provided there's
                  room), and a box is drawn around them on the catalog
                  screen.


       HELP filename
                  Name of a ".help" file to be used when the user
                  asks for help.


       HOME directory-name
                  Specify a directory to be used as the "home"
                  directory.  If a CNF file, gates file, help file,
                  or news file is not found in the current directory,
                  LOG looks next in this "home" directory, then
                  finally in "/lib/log".  The default "home" directory
                  is "~/log", that is, the "log" subdirectory of the
                  user's home directory.


       INCLUDE cnf-file
                  Read commands from the specified ".cnf" file, then
                  resume reading from this file.  Include files may
                  be nested.


       MENU gate gate gate ...
                  Load the specified gates into the menu area.  If
                  there are more gate names than menu slots, only the
                  first few names are used.  The first word may be
                  "+" to add the specified gates to a list from a
                  previous CNF file.


       NEWS file-name
                  Name of a ".text" file whose contents are displayed
                  when LOG begins.


       SIGNALS number
                  (or NODES.)  Specifies the maximum number of TO/FROM
                  signal names that can exist at one time during the
                  LOG session.  Default is 200.


       TABLET number
                  Set the HP-IB address of the graphics tablet to be
                  used.  Default is 0, which means look for the tablet
                  on the HP-HIL or at the standard address.


       TOOL tool-name "full-name"
                  Register a tool name so that the run-time TOOL command
                  will display its name.  (Ordinarily, tools are
                  automatically registered as soon as they are needed.)


       UNDO       Delete all "DO" commands registered up to this point.


       tool-name: tool-command
                  This directs a command to a particular LOG "tool".
                  The standard tool names are:

                        16       Digital simulator
                        32       Analog simulator
                        LPLOT    Plotting tool
                        LOGNTK   LOG-to-NTK tool
