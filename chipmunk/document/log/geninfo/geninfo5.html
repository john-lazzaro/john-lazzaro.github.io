<H1> More About Editing </H1>

<P>In the Editing menu there are commands for doing large-scale
circuit editing that would be unreasonable with just the basic
mouse motions:

<DL>
<DT> <B> Delete </B>
<DD> Press <B>Editing</B>, drag to <B>Delete</B>, release left mouse button.
Now when you move up into the drawing area, the cursor is shaped
like a pair of scissors.  You can now delete individual things by
touching them (with the point where the blades of the scissors
cross), or you can delete everything in a rectangular region by
pressing at one corner of the region and dragging to the opposite
corner.  Press the right button to exit Delete mode.  You can also
press the "d" key to get the Delete mode scissors. Due to an
intermittent bug, you may need to click the right button a second
time for the scissors to appear.
<DT> <B> Paste </B>
<DD>After you have deleted a group of objects, you can
select <B>Paste</B> to "paste" down copies of what was in that region.
The Paste command highlights the region that was actually
deleted; you can paste back in there for a simple "undelete,"
or you can paste other places for moving or replicating a chunk
of the circuit.  This is also on the "*" key.
<DT> <B> Copy </B>
<DD>This is similar to Delete, except that it doesn't actually
delete the contents of the rectangle.  It is for making copies
of something without disturbing the original.  After you have
copied your object or area of objects, you are automatically
switched into Paste mode.  This is also on the "/" key.
<DT> <B> Move </B>
<DD>Move an area.  This command is like a Delete followed by
a Paste; it moves an object, or all the objects in a given area,
to a new location.  It is also on the "m" key.  Note that
the pressing "m" and tapping on a wire moves the wire in a
different (often useful) way than simply grabbing the wire.
<DT> <B> Implicit Move/Copy</B>
<DD> Pressing in empty space and dragging out a
box automatically does a combination Move and Copy command.  The
first place you select moves the contents of the box to that place;
if you press at additional places, extra copies are drawn there.

<H2> Loading and Saving Circuits </H2>

<P>To save your circuit, select <B>Save</B> in the <B>Misc</B> menu, then type
the file name to use.  It's a good idea to hit Shift-S, or type
":save", periodically to save the circuit under the previous name
if any changes have been made.  ":save" with no file name argument
saves all pages which have been editing back into their original
files.  Circuits are saved in files ending with ".lgf" (for Log
Format).  The previous version of the file is backed up under the
same name but with ".lfo".</P>

<P>To load a circuit you have saved before, select <B>Load</B> from
the <B>Misc</B> menu, and type the name of the file you wish to load.
Analog saves the complete simulation state along with the circuit, but
you may want to do a RESET after loading anyway.</P>

<H2> Annotating Circuits </H2>

<P> The <B>Labels</B> command in the <B>Frills</B> menu lets you add
text labels to your diagram.  Select Labels, type the label you want,
then grab it and drag it, as usual, into place.  You can edit a label
by tapping it, then using the keyboard.  Labels generally have no
effect on the simulation, but they make plots look much nicer.  Also,
certain tools such as Logntk and the Digital Log hierarchical
simulation gates can read the labels for additional information about
the circuit.</P>

<P>The <B>Boxes</B> command in the <B>Frills</B> menu adds yellow dashed boxes
to the diagram, again for cosmetic purposes only.  Once you're
in Boxes mode, you can drag out boxes in the usual fashion.
To edit boxes, grab a corner for reshaping or an edge for
moving.  Both labels and boxes can be deleted by throwing them
off the bottom corners of the screen. </P>

<H2> Visual Aids for Editing </H2>

<P>The <B>Grid</B> command in the <B>Cursor</B> menu switches between the
usual arrow cursor and a cross-hair cursor which is useful for
aligning things. </P>

<P>The <B>Yardstick</B> command in the <B>Frills</B> menu lets you draw an
arrow on the screen which you can use to check the geometric
arrangement of objects on the screen.  The yardsticks are not
"real"---they go away when you refresh the screen.  You can also
press the "y" key to get a yardstick. </P>

<H2> Status </H2>

<P>If you select <B>Status</B> from the <B>Misc</B> menu, you get a
set of screens describing various aspects of the Log system.  Move
from screen to screen with the arrow keys.  The first screen includes
the date and time, amount of memory free (approx.), plus various other
stuff.  Later screens display the status of the Log editing buffers
and keyboard mappings, then there is a screen for the Lplot program
(that handles the Plot command), and for the analog simulator. </P>
