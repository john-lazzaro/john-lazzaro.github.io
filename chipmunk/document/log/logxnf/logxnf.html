<P> Ingo Cyliax (last known email address: cyliax@cs.indiana.edu)
developed several tools to support Diglog as a schematic capture
environment for Xilinx FPGA chips. For several years, he maintained an
FTP site at Indiana University that hosted these tools.
Unfortunately, the FTP site is no longer active, and I've lost track
of Ingo.  If anyone has information on a website that is hosting these
tools, please let me know (see email below) and I'll update this page.
</P>

XNF netlist generation</A> 
<DD>This tool converts NTK netlist files,
generated by Diglog, into XNF netlists.

Sample designs</A> 
<DD>Several sample designs for using Diglog to create
Xilinx netlists.

<P> Note that in order to create complete designs, you will still need
to have access to the Xilinx core FPGA tools.  The entry level
pacakage of just the core tools which can target the smaller Xilinx
chips (up to 3042 and 4003) is available for $1000 from several chip
suppliers. Chipmunk and this pacakage is an inexpensive way to program
Xilinx FPGAs. </P>
