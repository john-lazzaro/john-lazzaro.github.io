<PRE>

In order of appearance, these are the functions that make up the
resfloat.c gate:


Ex_Resfloat(act) -- this does a single simulation pass for the model. The
first part of this code:

  WITH = act->inst;
  A_Gate = (Anainstlist *)WITH->info;
  ResfloatVar = (ResfloatConst *)A_Gate->InstVar;
  Pin1Ptr = (AnaExt_rec *)WITH->pin[0]->info;
  Pin1 = Pin1Ptr->nodenum;
  VPin1 = Pin1Ptr->last;
  Pin2Ptr = (AnaExt_rec *)WITH->pin[1]->info;
  Pin2 = Pin2Ptr->nodenum;
  VPin2 = Pin2Ptr->last;   /*Use with statement to get to internal variables*/

Simply gets the current voltages for the two pins of the resistor; the
voltage on pin 1 of the gate is stored in the variable VPin1, for example.
The responsibility of an Ex_ procedure in analog is, given the voltages
on the pins, calculate:

	- the current input each pin
	- the derivative of this current with the voltage of each pin on
	  the gate. This calculation for the resistor is done with the
	  following lines:

  MinI1 = ResfloatVar->Conductance * (VPin2 - VPin1);
  MinI2 = -MinI1;
  dI1dV1 = ResfloatVar->Conductance;
  dI1dV2 = -ResfloatVar->Conductance;
  dI2dV1 = -ResfloatVar->Conductance;
  dI2dV2 = ResfloatVar->Conductance;

Once this calculation is done, the next responsibility for an Ex_ routine
is to add them in the proper place in the matrix. Here's the code that
does that:

  WITH2 = AnaSystem;
  WITH2->Mat[Pin1][AnaSysCol] += MinI1;
  WITH2->Mat[Pin2][AnaSysCol] += MinI2;
  WITH2->Mat[Pin1][Pin1] += dI1dV1;
  WITH2->Mat[Pin1][Pin2] += dI1dV2;
  WITH2->Mat[Pin2][Pin1] += dI2dV1;
  WITH2->Mat[Pin2][Pin2] += dI2dV2;

An additional resposibility is to set flags on every Matrix position you
changed, so that optimizations can be done by the equation solver for
zero-valued matrix positions:

  WITH2->MatNZ[Pin1][AnaSysCol] = true;
  WITH2->MatNZ[Pin2][AnaSysCol] = true;
  WITH2->MatNZ[Pin1][Pin1] = true;
  WITH2->MatNZ[Pin1][Pin2] = true;
  WITH2->MatNZ[Pin2][Pin1] = true;
  WITH2->MatNZ[Pin2][Pin2] = true;

And finally, there are parasitic linear capacitors on every node of
every gate by default, these caps get executed automatically by this
final line:

  AnaCapex(act->inst);   /*Does execution of node capacitors*/


----

The next routine is Iin_Resfloat(act). Its job is as follows: you may
note that when you use the simulator, you can current meters on any
gate pin and get a current out. The Iin_ routine's job is to calculate
this current. The first part of the routine finds all the variables and
brings them in:

  WITH = act->inst;
  A_Gate = (Anainstlist *)WITH->info;
  ResfloatVar = (ResfloatConst *)A_Gate->InstVar;
  Pin1Ptr = (AnaExt_rec *)WITH->pin[0]->info;
  VPin1 = Pin1Ptr->now;
  VMem1 = A_Gate->Pininfo[0].Vmem;
  Pin2Ptr = (AnaExt_rec *)WITH->pin[1]->info;
  VPin2 = Pin2Ptr->now;
  VMem2 = A_Gate->Pininfo[1].Vmem;

Note a new voltage set, Vmem; it is the charge stored on all the linear
capacitors (or more properly, the voltage implied by Q=CV.). Once these
are available, a different calculation happens depending on which pin
a current is requested for; a switch statement is done:

  switch (act->pin) {

To determine the case. For example, for pin 1 of the resistor:

  case 1:
    WITH = act->inst;
    act->Iin = ResfloatVar->Conductance * (VPin1 - VPin2) + act->Iin;
    AnaCapIin(act);
    break;

The value of act->Iin increased by the current that I = V/R dictates.
Then, the current due to the linear capacitors is added automatically
by AnaCapIin(act).

The other routines are more "housekeeping". GetCnf_Resfloat(NewIC)
reads in the configuration information for gates held in the file
log/lib/models.cnf; here's the lines in that file that concerns
resistors:


32: Resfloat  Res 1000

That sets the default value of a resistor to be 1K. Here's the part
of GetCnf_Resfloat(NewIC) that reads it:

  Char *STR1;

  WITH = NewIC;
  do {
    AnaGetcommand("RESFLOAT", Arg, &Found);
    if (Found) {
      (*AnaLogglobals->hook.getword)(Arg, Keyword);
      if (!strcmp(Keyword, "RES")) {
        TRY(try1);
          WITH->ICRes = strtod(Arg, &STR1);
          Dummy = STR1 - Arg + 1;
        RECOVER(try1);
          WITH->ICRes = 1000.0;
        ENDTRY(try1);
      }
    }
  } while (Found);
}

The first part (AnaGetcommand("RESFLOAT", Arg, &Found);) sees if there
are any unprocessed lines that start with RESFLOAT, the name of the gate.
If there is, Found is set. If so, the "KEYWORD" is then gotten, which is
the word following RESFLOAT that indicates what parameter is being
set. 

      (*AnaLogglobals->hook.getword)(Arg, Keyword);

We check to see if that parameter is of interest

      if (!strcmp(Keyword, "RES")) {

And if so we set the initial condition variable for the resistance
parameter, ICRes, to be the numerical value of the string returned in
Arg

        TRY(try1);
          WITH->ICRes = strtod(Arg, &STR1);
          Dummy = STR1 - Arg + 1;

If it turns out the string in the file was not of proper format, we
put in some hard-coded default that should make some sense:

        RECOVER(try1);
          WITH->ICRes = 1000.0;
        ENDTRY(try1);

And we keep doing this until no parameters are left

      }
    }
  } while (Found);
}

The next routine of interest gets called once, at the time the program
is started by the user; this routine tells the simulator what a gate
is all about, by filling out the record act->kind->info. Like lots
of what I've shown in this email, its all very stylized stuff. We
This routine, initlib_Resfloat, looks like this:

Local Void initlib_Resfloat(act)
Analog_32_action *act;
{
  AnaCell_rec *NewCell;
  ICResfloat *NewIC;

  NewCell = NULL;
  NewCell = (AnaCell_rec *)Malloc(sizeof(AnaCell_rec));
  NewCell->simulatable = true;
  NewCell->intr_cell = 0;
  NewCell->phase = Anasimple;
  NewCell->plist_cell = (Anapinrec *)Malloc(sizeof(Anapinrec) * act->kind->numpins);
  NewCell->plist_cell[0].standalone = false;
  NewCell->plist_cell[0].active = true;
  NewCell->plist_cell[1].standalone = false;
  NewCell->plist_cell[1].active = true;
  NewIC = (ICResfloat *)Malloc(sizeof(ICResfloat));
  NewIC->ICRes = 1000.0;
  GetCnf_Resfloat(NewIC);
  NewCell->Ainfo = (Anyptr)NewIC;
  act->kind->info = (Anyptr)NewCell;
}  /*Resfloat_Initlib*/

The first part just makes storage for the descriptor NewCell:

  NewCell = NULL;
  NewCell = (AnaCell_rec *)Malloc(sizeof(AnaCell_rec));

Then we set flags of interest. On flag indicates the cell in fact does
simulate (for example, meters do not simulate):

  NewCell->simulatable = true;

The next flag is "reserved for future use", and should always be set
for zero:

  NewCell->intr_cell = 0;

The next flag indicates if this will be the kind of gate that has little
"lights" that glow on its surface, like the voltage sources do when they
"crowbar". This may in fact be handy for your transistor models, but for
now I'll assume your gates won't do this, like the resistor doesn`t do 
this:

  NewCell->phase = Anasimple;

The next set of flags describe each individual pin on the gate, so that
special gates like meters work well. For a normal simulatable gate, just
follow the pattern for a resistor:

  NewCell->plist_cell = (Anapinrec *)Malloc(sizeof(Anapinrec) * act->kind->numpins);
  NewCell->plist_cell[0].standalone = false;
  NewCell->plist_cell[0].active = true;
  NewCell->plist_cell[1].standalone = false;
  NewCell->plist_cell[1].active = true;

The next set of stuff makes the "initial condition" block that we
stored into when we read from the models.cnf file in an earlier procedure.
It also puts into this block the default parameters (in this case, a
resistor having 1K value):

  NewIC = (ICResfloat *)Malloc(sizeof(ICResfloat));
  NewIC->ICRes = 1000.0;

Finally, some stuff that sets everything up correctly:

  GetCnf_Resfloat(NewIC);
  NewCell->Ainfo = (Anyptr)NewIC;
  act->kind->info = (Anyptr)NewCell;
}  /*Resfloat_Initlib*/

The next routine is what gets activated when you change the "attributes"
of a gate during simulation; it gets called when a user hits "return"
when he changes a parameter:


Local boolean Resfloatcheck(Inst, Attrnum)
log_grec *Inst;
long Attrnum;
{
  boolean Result;
  ResfloatConst *ResfloatVar;
  Anainstlist *A_Gate;

  Result = true;
  A_Gate = (Anainstlist *)Inst->info;
  ResfloatVar = (ResfloatConst *)A_Gate->InstVar;
  switch (Attrnum) {

  case N_Res:
    if (Inst->attr[Attrnum - 1].UU.r <= 0 || Inst->attr[Attrnum - 1].blnk ||
        Inst->attr[Attrnum - 1].UU.r > AnaResTooBig)
      Result = false;
    else
      ResfloatVar->Conductance = 1 / Inst->attr[N_Res - 1].UU.r;
    break;
  }
  return Result;
}

It starts out by loading in various needed variables:

  Result = true;
  A_Gate = (Anainstlist *)Inst->info;
  ResfloatVar = (ResfloatConst *)A_Gate->InstVar;

It then does a switch statement, depending on which attribute the user
is editing; since resistors only have one, its a simple case statement
of one entry:

  case N_Res:
    if (Inst->attr[Attrnum - 1].UU.r <= 0 || Inst->attr[Attrnum - 1].blnk ||
        Inst->attr[Attrnum - 1].UU.r > AnaResTooBig)
      Result = false;
    else
      ResfloatVar->Conductance = 1 / Inst->attr[N_Res - 1].UU.r;
    break;
  }

Basically, what the user typed is held in Inst->attr[Attrnum - 1].UU.r .
We check to make sure the user didn't put in a negative resistance
value, or a resistor that's way too big (AnaResTooBig), or set the
field to a "blank". If they did this, we set

Result = false;

Which results in the interface "rejecting" what the user typed. If the
user didn't make such a mistake, we accept the new value, and 
recalculate the internal storage of what the conductance of the
resistor is:

ResfloatVar->Conductance = 1 / Inst->attr[N_Res - 1].UU.r;

The next routine, Attr_Resfloat, interfaces Resfloatcheck with the
simulator:


Local Void Attr_Resfloat(act)
Analog_32_action *act;
{
  long Attrnum;

  Attrnum = act->pin;
  if (Attrnum >= Cstart && Attrnum <= Cstart + 5)
    AnaCapattrinsert((long)Cstart, Attrnum, act->inst, &act->ok);
  else
    act->ok = Resfloatcheck(act->inst, Attrnum);
}

Its main job is to check to see if the user is changing the value of
the capacitors 

  if (Attrnum >= Cstart && Attrnum <= Cstart + 5)

and if so diverting the request to an internal log routine

    AnaCapattrinsert((long)Cstart, Attrnum, act->inst, &act->ok);

The next routine, Newgate_Resfloat, gets called everytime a user makes
an instance of a gate. 

Local Void Newgate_Resfloat(act)
Analog_32_action *act;
{
  ResfloatConst *ResfloatVar;
  Anainstlist *A_Gate;
  AnaCell_rec *Cellptr;
  ICResfloat *ICptr;
  log_grec *WITH;

  Cellptr = (AnaCell_rec *)act->inst->kind->info;
  ICptr = (ICResfloat *)Cellptr->Ainfo;
  ResfloatVar = (ResfloatConst *)Malloc(sizeof(ResfloatConst));
  ResfloatVar->Conductance = 1 / ICptr->ICRes;
  A_Gate = (Anainstlist *)act->inst->info;
  A_Gate->InstVar = (Anyptr)ResfloatVar;
  AnaCapInit(act->inst);
  WITH = act->inst;
  WITH->attr[N_Res - 1].UU.r = ICptr->ICRes;
  WITH->attr[N_Res - 1].blnk = false;
  WITH->attr[N_Res - 1].changed = true;
}


Most of this is allocating storage for the gate's state, but it also
includes initializing the parameters displayed on the attribute
screen:

  WITH->attr[N_Res - 1].UU.r = ICptr->ICRes;
  WITH->attr[N_Res - 1].blnk = false;
  WITH->attr[N_Res - 1].changed = true;

As well as the internal state:

  ResfloatVar->Conductance = 1 / ICptr->ICRes;

The next routine, Copygate_Resfloat, gets called when a user makes
a "copy" of a gate already on the screen, by using the copy/paste
or delete replace commands:


Local Void Copygate_Resfloat(act)
Analog_32_action *act;
{
  ResfloatConst *ResfloatVar, *Old_Resfloatvar;
  Anainstlist *A_Gate, *A_Oldgate;

  /*If any internal variables then*/
  A_Oldgate = (Anainstlist *)AnaLogglobals->actgate2->info;
  Old_Resfloatvar = (ResfloatConst *)A_Oldgate->InstVar;
  ResfloatVar = (ResfloatConst *)Malloc(sizeof(ResfloatConst));
  *ResfloatVar = *Old_Resfloatvar;
  A_Gate = (Anainstlist *)act->inst->info;
  A_Gate->InstVar = (Anyptr)ResfloatVar;
  /*Always Do*/
  AnaCapCopy(act->inst);
}

Its main purpose is to propagate state, so that the new copy of
the gate has the same attributes as the old. The next routine,
Dispose_Resfloat, gets called when a user deletes a gate on the
screen. It basically is used to free the memory malloced when
the gate is created:


Local Void Dispose_Resfloat(act)
Analog_32_action *act;
{
  ResfloatConst *ResfloatVar;
  Anainstlist *A_Gate;

  A_Gate = (Anainstlist *)act->inst->info;
  ResfloatVar = (ResfloatConst *)A_Gate->InstVar;
  Free(ResfloatVar);
  AnaCapDispose(act->inst);   /*7*/
}

The next routine, Readgate_Resfloat, happens when the user reads
in a schematic from a file; it gets called once for each resistor
that was in the schematic. Its job is to read in the value of
attributes stored in the file into the gate itself:

Local Void Readgate_Resfloat(act)
Analog_32_action *act;
{
  ResfloatConst *ResfloatVar;
  Anainstlist *A_Gate;
  log_grec *WITH1;

  AnaCapattrread((long)Cstart, act->inst);   /*Read capacitors*/
  A_Gate = (Anainstlist *)act->inst->info;
  ResfloatVar = (ResfloatConst *)A_Gate->InstVar;
  WITH1 = act->inst;
  ResfloatVar->Conductance = 1 / WITH1->attr[N_Res - 1].UU.r;
}

The next routine, Probe_Resfloat, is used to display information
about the gate when the user is in Probemode; if you haven't
played with Probemode yet, check out the Probe item in the 
Cursor menu. 


Local Void Probe_Resfloat(act)
Analog_32_action *act;
{
  Anainstlist *A_Gate;
  AnaExt_rec *Node1Ptr, *Node2Ptr;
  double Node1, Node2, Pin1, Pin2, d;
  Char Name1[256], Name2[256];
  log_grec *WITH;
  Char STR1[22];
  Char STR2[256];
  Char STR3[256];

  WITH = act->inst;
  A_Gate = (Anainstlist *)WITH->info;
  Pin1 = A_Gate->Pininfo[0].Vmem;
  Pin2 = A_Gate->Pininfo[1].Vmem;
  Node1Ptr = (AnaExt_rec *)WITH->pin[0]->info;
  Node2Ptr = (AnaExt_rec *)WITH->pin[1]->info;
  Node1 = Node1Ptr->ltimestep;
  Node2 = Node2Ptr->ltimestep;
  if (Node1 != Pin1 || Node2 != Pin2 || Node1 == AnaNotyet || Node2 == AnaNotyet) {
    sprintf(STR1, "%s <undefined>", Gatename);
    AnaScoreboard(STR1, (long)AnaMessGate1);
    AnaScoreboard("$", (long)AnaMessGate2);
    return;
  }
  d = Pin1 - Pin2;
  if (d >= 0) {
    strcpy(Name1, " (+)");
    strcpy(Name2, " (-)");
  } else {
    d = -d;
    strcpy(Name1, " (-)");
    strcpy(Name2, " (+)");
  }
  switch (AnaLogglobals->probepin) {

  case 0:
    AnaScoreboard(Gatename, (long)AnaMessGate1);
    break;

  case 1:
    sprintf(STR2, "%s%s", Gatename, Name1);
    AnaScoreboard(STR2, (long)AnaMessGate1);
    break;

  case 2:
    sprintf(STR2, "%s%s", Gatename, Name2);
    AnaScoreboard(STR2, (long)AnaMessGate1);
    break;
  }
  sprintf(STR2, "dV = %s", AnaProbeVoltStr(STR3, d));
  AnaScoreboard(STR2, (long)AnaMessGate2);
}

The routine checks to see if the probe in over a pin of the
gate, or over the body of the gate. If a pin, it calls 
AnaScoreboard with strings to display describing the state
of the pin, if the body gate, it calls AnaScoreboard with
strings to display describing the state of the gate itself.
Play with the simulator to see examples of information 
displayed by transistors and other gates.

Finally, there is a "dispatch" routine, that log talks to
directly. This routine figures out what "action" is 
requested by the gate, and calls one of the routines I 
just described above:


Void Log_resfloat_initlib_32(act)
Analog_32_action *act;
{
  /*Main Procedure*/


  switch (act->action) {

  case Analog_act_newkind:
    initlib_Resfloat(act);
    break;

  case Analog_act_ex:
    Ex_Resfloat(act);
    break;

  case Analog_act_update:   /*8*/
    AnaCapUpdate(act->inst);
    break;

  case Analog_act_pass1:
    AnaCappass1(act->inst);
    break;

  case Analog_act_pass2:
    AnaCappass2(act->inst);
    break;

  case Analog_act_attrchange:
    Attr_Resfloat(act);
    break;

  case Analog_act_reset:
    AnaCapReset(act->inst);
    break;

  case Analog_act_newgate:
    Newgate_Resfloat(act);
    break;

  case Analog_act_copygate:
    Copygate_Resfloat(act);
    break;

  case Analog_act_disposegate:
    Dispose_Resfloat(act);
    break;

  case Analog_act_openconfig:
    AnaCapattrload((long)Cstart, act->inst, act->ok);
    break;

  case Analog_act_readgate:
    Readgate_Resfloat(act);
    break;

  case Analog_act_writegate:
    AnaCapattrwrite((long)Cstart, act->inst);
    break;

  case Analog_act_Iin:
    Iin_Resfloat(act);
    break;

  case Analog_act_probe:
    Probe_Resfloat(act);
    break;
  }
}
