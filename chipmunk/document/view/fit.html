<P> <B> Fit </B> is a native view command added by Harold Levy, for fitting
arbitrary nonlinear functions to data. Here is what is printed in
view in response to "help" for fit. </P>

<PRE>

fit  &lt data &gt   &lt function &gt   &lt param1 &gt   &lt param2 &gt  ...
  Fit a computed function to a data curve with the same
  basis.  This is done via simplex minimization of chi^2
  over the specified parameters of the function.  The
  constant "fit_tol" is used to specify the goodness
  of fit, and is created with a default value of 0.001
  if not previously set.  Output can be redirected to a
  specified file if the "  &gt  file_name" convention is
  appended to the command line.

here is a simple example to type in to understand "fit"

basis i = 1:100:1   ## make a straight line curve
a = 10              ## make up some variables
b = 100             ## make up some variables
y == a*i + b        ## set up a model equation for a straight line
fplot y i           ## note how parameter a and b are a bad fit to data i
fit i y a b         ## run the fit program
fplot y i           ## note the better fit

<P> Here is a more intense example ... </P>

basis v=0:5:1                                   ## independent variable
i = 1.23e-6 * log(1+exp((v-.67)/.05))^2         ## here's the data
i0 = 1                                          ## make up some variables
vt = 1                                          ## make up some variables
f == i0 * log(1+exp((v-vt)/.05))^2              ## here's the model
fplot i f                                       ## look at initial bad fit
fit i f i0 vt                                   ## fit with fit_tol = 1e-3
fplot i f                                       ## look at better fit
fit_tol = 1e-12                                 ## try for even better
fit i f i0 vt                                   ## fit with better guess
style 1 circ                                    ## here's new plot style
fplot i@1 f                                     ## look at best fit
list i0 vt                                      ## dump the values
