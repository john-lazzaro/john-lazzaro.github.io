<H1> Documentation for View </H1>

<P> Documentation for view consists of three manuals, written by Dave
Gillespie, in Postscript. These manuals are basically untouched from
the pre-Unix version of view, and are in need of updating, in addition
to HTML conversion. </P>

<DL>
<DT> <B>User manual </B> 
<DD> This manual serves as an introduction to view. Press <A
HREF="view.ps">here</A> to view the document.
<DT> <B>Language manual </B> 
<DD> This manual describes the scripting language of view. Press <A
HREF="viewprg.ps">here</A> to view the document.
<DT> <B>Programmers manual </B> 
<DD> This manual describes how to write new tools for view. It was
written for the Pascal version of view. However, since the port to C
was done using a Pascal-to-C translator, it isn't too difficult to
apply the information in the manual to C programming. Press <A
HREF="viewmod.ps">here</A> to view the document.

<P> One major feature added (by Harold Levy, Caltech) after the port
to Unix, and thus not described in the manuals above, is a package for
arbitrary non-linear curve fitting. Here is brief <A HREF="fit.html">
documentation</A> on this package. </P>

<P> Several libraries, written in view language, are included with view.
On-line help, and comments in the library source, form the main documentation
of these libraries. Here is a list of libraries. Click on the library
name to see the source. </P>

<DL>
<DT> <B> <A HREF="lib/crunch.view">crunch.view</A></B>

<DD> Adds error bars to a curve.
<DT> <B> <A HREF="lib/examples.view">examples.view</A></B>
